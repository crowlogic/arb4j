## Jacobi Weight Function Definition
The Jacobi weight function, denoted as ωα,β(x), is a fundamental component in the theory of Jacobi polynomials and is defined as:

$ωα,β(x)=(1-x)α(1+x)β$

where x ∈ \[-1, 1\] and α, β > -1 [1](https://lsec.cc.ac.cn/~hyu/teaching/shonm2013/STWchap3.2p.pdf) [2](https://personal.ntu.edu.sg/lilian/ANUM09GenJacobi.pdf). This weight function plays a crucial role in defining the orthogonality of Jacobi polynomials.

The parameters α and β determine the behavior of the weight function near the endpoints of the interval \[-1, 1\]. As x approaches 1, the term (1-x)α dominates, while as x approaches -1, the term (1+x)β becomes more significant. This allows for a flexible representation of various physical and mathematical phenomena.

The condition α, β > -1 ensures that the weight function is integrable over the interval \[-1, 1\] [1](https://lsec.cc.ac.cn/~hyu/teaching/shonm2013/STWchap3.2p.pdf). This integrability is essential for the existence of the associated orthogonal polynomials and for the convergence of various related series expansions.

The Jacobi weight function generalizes several other important weight functions:

1.  When α = β = 0, it reduces to the constant weight function, corresponding to Legendre polynomials.
2.  For α = β = -1/2, it yields the weight function for Chebyshev polynomials of the first kind.
3.  When α = β = 1/2, it gives the weight function for Chebyshev polynomials of the second kind [3](https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/dema-1995-0122/pdf).

The versatility of the Jacobi weight function allows for the study of a wide range of orthogonal polynomials and their applications in various fields, including approximation theory, numerical analysis, and mathematical physics [4](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/222557104_Generalized_Jacobi_Polynomialsfunctions_and_their_applications).

## Change of Variables Explained
The change of variables technique is a crucial step in evaluating the Fourier transform of the Jacobi weight function. This transformation simplifies the integral and connects it to well-known special functions.

The initial integral for the Fourier transform is:

$\hat{w}(t)=\int_{-1}^1(1-x)^\alpha (1+x)^\beta e^{-ixt}\,dx$

We introduce the substitution u = (1+x)/2, which maps the interval \[-1,1\] to \[0,1\]. This change of variables is chosen because:

1.  It simplifies the limits of integration to standard values (0 and 1).
2.  It transforms the factors (1-x) and (1+x) into forms that relate directly to the Beta function.

The transformation details are as follows:

*   x = 2u - 1
*   dx = 2du
*   When x = -1, u = 0
*   When x = 1, u = 1

Applying this substitution, the integral becomes:

$\hat{w}(t)=2^{1+\alpha+\beta}\int_0^1(1-u)^\alpha u^\beta e^{-i(2u-1)t}\,du$

The factor 2^(1+α+β) arises from the combination of the 2du from the differential and the transformations of (1-x)^α and (1+x)^β [1](https://hal.science/hal-01116888/document).

This new form of the integral is significant because it resembles the integral representation of the confluent hypergeometric function. The exponential term can be further simplified:

$e^{-i(2u-1)t}=e^{-i2ut}e^{it}$

This separation allows us to pull out the e^(it) factor, leaving an integral that directly relates to the confluent hypergeometric function [1](https://hal.science/hal-01116888/document) [2](https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/document?repid=rep1&type=pdf&doi=6044a0eecbf2712501c13644eaa69c2d788be4bf).

The change of variables is a pivotal step that bridges the gap between the original Jacobi weight function and the hypergeometric functions, which in turn lead to the Bessel function representation in the final result. This transformation showcases the deep connections between different classes of special functions and their integral representations.

## Hypergeometric to Bessel Transformation
The transformation from hypergeometric functions to Bessel functions is a crucial step in deriving the Fourier transform of the Jacobi weight function. This process involves several key mathematical relationships and transformations.

The confluent hypergeometric function $\_1F\_1(a;b;z)$, also known as Kummer's function, serves as a bridge between the integral representation and the final Bessel function form [1](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/2981994/a-connection-between-the-confluent-hypergeometric-function-and-bessel-functions). The transformation begins with the integral:

$\int_0^1u^\beta (1-u)^\alpha e^{-i2ut}\,du=B(\alpha+1,\beta+1){}_1F_1(\beta+1;\alpha+\beta+2;-2it)$

where $B(\\alpha+1,\\beta+1)$ is the Beta function.

To convert this hypergeometric representation to a Bessel function, we apply a series of transformations:

1.  Kummer's transformation:  
    ${}_1F_1(a;b;z)=e^z{}_1F_1(b-a;b;-z)$
2.  The limiting relation between confluent hypergeometric and Bessel functions:  
    $J_\nu(z)=\frac{(z/2)^\nu}{\Gamma(\nu+1)}{}_0F_1(;\nu+1;-z^2/4)$
3.  Hankel's contour integral representation:  
    $J_\nu(z)=\frac{z^\nu}{2^\nu \Gamma(\nu+1)}{}_0F_1\left(;\nu+1;-\frac{z^2}{4}\right)$

These transformations allow us to express the integral in terms of the Bessel function of the first kind [2](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/abs/special-functions/bessel-functions-and-confluent-hypergeometric-functions/7E6AD109A5A65842313C079D4EC6B1C6):

$\int_0^1(1-u)^\alpha u^\beta e^{-i2ut}\,du=B(\alpha+1,\beta+1)\frac{J_{\alpha+\beta+1}(2t)}{(2t)^{\alpha+\beta+1}}$

The appearance of the Bessel function in this context is not coincidental. Bessel functions naturally arise in problems involving cylindrical or spherical symmetry, which is inherent in the structure of the Jacobi weight function [3](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/3765265/bessel-functions-in-terms-of-the-confluent-hypergeometric-function). The order of the Bessel function, $\\alpha+\\beta+1$, reflects the combined influence of both parameters of the Jacobi weight function.

This transformation showcases the deep connections between different classes of special functions. The confluent hypergeometric function, which generalizes many elementary and special functions, serves as an intermediary between the polynomial-like structure of the Jacobi weight function and the oscillatory nature of Bessel functions [4](https://campus.mst.edu/adsa/contents/v8n2p16.pdf).

The resulting Bessel function representation is particularly useful because Bessel functions have well-known asymptotic behaviors and integral representations. This allows for further analysis of the Fourier transform, especially for large values of the transform variable $t$ [5](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10652469.2020.1752687).

## Final Fourier Transform Result
The final Fourier transform result for the Jacobi weight function is a powerful expression that encapsulates the complex interplay between Jacobi polynomials, hypergeometric functions, and Bessel functions. The transform is given by:

$\hat{w}(t)=2^{\alpha+\beta+1}\Gamma(\alpha+1)\Gamma(\beta+1)\frac{J_{\alpha+\beta+1}(2t)}{(2t)^{\alpha+\beta+1}}e^{it}$

This result is significant for several reasons:

1.  Bessel Function Representation: The appearance of the Bessel function $J\_{\\alpha+\\beta+1}(2t)$ in the numerator reflects the oscillatory nature of the transform [1](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.07869.pdf). The order $\\alpha+\\beta+1$ combines the influence of both Jacobi parameters, showcasing how these parameters affect the frequency content of the weight function.
2.  Gamma Function Factors: The presence of $\\Gamma(\\alpha+1)$ and $\\Gamma(\\beta+1)$ relates to the normalization of the Jacobi polynomials and ensures proper scaling of the transform [2](https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/DD81F07404AAF4A8EC6BACD7491F1F3C/S1446788714000500a.pdf/finite_fourier_transform_of_classical_polynomials.pdf).
3.  Power Term: The $(2t)^{\\alpha+\\beta+1}$ in the denominator balances the growth of the Bessel function for large arguments, ensuring the transform remains well-behaved as $t$ increases.
4.  Phase Factor: The $e^{it}$ term carries essential phase information, reflecting the asymmetry of the original weight function on the interval \[-1,1\] [1](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.07869.pdf).
5.  Scaling Factor: The $2^{\\alpha+\\beta+1}$ factor accounts for the change of variables and normalization in the derivation process.

This result has important applications in spectral methods and approximation theory. For instance, it allows for efficient computation of Fourier-Jacobi coefficients using fast Fourier transform (FFT) techniques when both $2\\alpha$ and $2\\beta$ are odd integers [3](https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/document?repid=rep1&type=pdf&doi=6044a0eecbf2712501c13644eaa69c2d788be4bf). This can significantly reduce computational costs from $O(N^2)$ to $O(N \\log N)$ for large N.

The transform also provides insights into the asymptotic behavior of Jacobi polynomials. As $t$ grows large, the Bessel function in the numerator oscillates with decreasing amplitude, while the power term in the denominator causes overall decay. This behavior is crucial in understanding the convergence properties of Fourier-Jacobi series [4](https://cm.episciences.org/10412/pdf).

Furthermore, this result serves as a foundation for studying weighted integrability of Fourier-Jacobi transforms. Recent research has established sufficient conditions for such weighted integrability, generalizing classical results like the Titchmarsh theorem to the Jacobi polynomial context [5](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10652469.2022.2140801).

In practical applications, this transform result enables the analysis of functions expanded in Jacobi polynomials in the frequency domain, offering new perspectives on problems in mathematical physics, signal processing, and numerical analysis where Jacobi polynomials play a central role.

## Phase Information in Fourier Transforms of Weight Functions
The phase information in Fourier transforms of weight functions, such as the Jacobi weight function, plays a crucial role in preserving the complete characteristics of the original function. In the case of the Fourier transform of the Jacobi weight function, the phase is represented by the $e^{it}$ term in the final result.

This phase factor is essential for several reasons:

1.  Asymmetry Preservation: The $e^{it}$ term captures the asymmetry of the original Jacobi weight function on the interval \[-1,1\]. Without this phase information, the transform would lose critical details about the function's behavior across its domain [1](https://dsp.stackexchange.com/questions/59580/understanding-the-phase-in-dft).
2.  Complex-Valued Nature: The presence of the phase factor ensures that the Fourier transform is complex-valued, which is necessary for a complete representation of the original function. This complex nature allows for the reconstruction of both the magnitude and phase of the original signal [2].
3.  Time-Shift Information: The phase component encodes information about time shifts or delays in the original function. In the context of the Jacobi weight function, this relates to the relative positions of features within the \[-1,1\] interval [1](https://dsp.stackexchange.com/questions/59580/understanding-the-phase-in-dft).
4.  Interference Patterns: When combining multiple Fourier components, the phase information determines how these components interfere with each other. This is crucial for accurately reconstructing the original function from its Fourier representation [2].

The importance of phase in Fourier transforms extends beyond just the Jacobi weight function. In many applications, such as signal processing and image reconstruction, the phase often carries more perceptually relevant information than the magnitude spectrum [2]. For instance, in image processing, the phase spectrum is critical for edge detection and feature localization.

In the context of fast algorithms for Jacobi expansions, the phase information is essential for accurate numerical implementations. Recent developments in nonoscillatory phase functions have led to more efficient algorithms for evaluating Jacobi polynomials and their associated transforms [3](https://academic.oup.com/imajna/article/40/3/2019/5442213?login=false). These methods rely on a careful treatment of the phase to avoid numerical instabilities and improve computational efficiency.

Understanding and preserving phase information is also crucial when dealing with discrete Fourier transforms (DFT) of sampled data. The phase angle of each DFT bin corresponds directly to the phase argument in the continuous signal, typically measured in radians from -π to π [1](https://dsp.stackexchange.com/questions/59580/understanding-the-phase-in-dft). This relationship allows for accurate digital representation and manipulation of continuous functions like the Jacobi weight function.

In practical applications, such as spectral analysis of time-domain signals, the phase information in the Fourier transform helps identify and characterize different frequency components present in the original function [4](https://endaq.com/pages/fourier-transforms). This is particularly useful when analyzing complex signals that may have overlapping frequency content but different temporal characteristics.

By carefully considering the phase information alongside the magnitude spectrum, researchers and engineers can gain a more complete understanding of the underlying functions and signals they are analyzing, leading to more accurate and insightful interpretations of data in various scientific and engineering disciplines.
