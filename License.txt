===Licensed Work Definition===
The Licensed Work is the complete set of files, including source code, that come along with and/or are associated with the arb4j distribution 
that this license accompanies; including transformations of the source-code (such as but not limited to the compiled.class files or the dynamically 
generated .class files generated by the expression compilation capabilities of arb4j)

===Additional Use Grant===
Personal use of the Licensed Work is allowed without a Production Use license. There is a 1 month evaluation period for Production Use of arb4j; 
the evaluation period begins on the day that coincides with the first day of Production Use.

If the Licensed Work is used within a company, educational institution, non-profit organization, government, or any other form of organization 
for more than 30 days, a Production Usage license must be purchased from or gifted by the Licensor. The License for Production Use granted can 
be indeterminate or for a fixed period. Production usage means the use of any part of arb4j or any code (readable or machine-language) derived 
from or processed by code originating with arb4j for anything besides personal use.

Any commercial or financial related use whatsoever, even if on a Personal basis, is Production Use and requires a purchased or gifted license.

Exceptions to these terms for the purposes of testing and evaluation must be explicitly granted through the issuance of a separate contract by 
the Licensor. No verbal agreements, email communications, or other forms of correspondence shall modify these terms unless formalized in a new 
contract issued by the Licensor.
