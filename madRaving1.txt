Shut up don't start talking about a bunch of b******* The f****** thing is the z. Function is a oscillatory process. Realization and I want to compute the envelopes. I don't think I'll have to mess with the non stationary. Envelope, though because I can invert the form of the gain function. That determines the oscillatory function that determines the kernel. And that will then give me the stationary process corresponding to the z function and then I can show that. Actually, that's a realization of a random wave model with a Bessel function of the first kind of order 0 colonel. And the f****** there is a unique complex valued orthogonal. Random measure corresponding to the z function as a realization of said process
