arb4j is a Java wrapper around the fantastic and amazing arb library for ball arithmetic found at http://arblib.org

========================================================================
There is a project wiki at 
https://github.com/crowlogic/arb4j/wiki 
and a gallery of some renderings (including some fluidly animated sequences implying motion of some underlying dynamical system) produced with arb4j at
https://github.com/crowlogic/arb4j/wiki/Gallery 
=======================================================================
 
To build this library you will need the following:

SWIG (Tested with Versions 4.0.1 and 4.0.2)
libflint-arb-dev along with its dependencies (Tested with 2.19.0)
JDK (Tested with jdk-17 from Oracle)

Once you have acquired these, run the bash script in the bin/
subdirectory called "gaw" which stands for "generate arb wrapper",
which will then cause the .i files in the native/ subdirectory to be
parsed with SWIG and the corresponding java and C source files are generated.
After that happens, the script then calls the bin/caw which stands for
"compile arb wrapper" which, if all goes well, should leave a file
named libarblib.so in root directory of the project
