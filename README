arb4j is a Java wrapper around the fantastic and amazing arb library for 
ball arithmetic found at http://arblib.org

========================================================================
There is a project wiki at 
https://github.com/crowlogic/arb4j/wiki 
and gallery at
https://github.com/crowlogic/arb4j/wiki/Gallery 

and Javadocs can be found at 

https://crowlogic.github.io/

=======================================================================
 
To build this library you will need the following:

SWIG (Tested with Versions 4.0.1 and 4.0.2)
libflint-arb-dev along with its dependencies (Tested with 2.19.0)
JDK (Tested with jdk-17 from Oracle)

Once you have acquired these, run the bash script in the bin/
subdirectory called "gaw" which stands for "generate arb wrapper",
which will then cause the .i files in the native/ subdirectory to be
parsed with SWIG and the corresponding java and C source files are generated.
After that happens, the script then calls the bin/caw which stands for
"compile arb wrapper" which, if all goes well, should leave a file
named libarblib.so in root directory of the project

One should generally add "-ea" to  the JVM commandline to enable assertion 
checking but it can be turned off to slightly improve performance.

To run anything depending on chartfx the following commandline arguments needed to 
be added as well:

--add-modules=javafx.graphics
--add-reads javafx.graphics=ALL-UNNAMED
--add-opens javafx.controls/com.sun.javafx.charts=ALL-UNNAMED
--add-opens javafx.controls/com.sun.javafx.scene.control.inputmap=ALL-UNNAMED
--add-opens javafx.graphics/com.sun.javafx.iio=ALL-UNNAMED
--add-opens javafx.graphics/com.sun.javafx.iio.common=ALL-UNNAMED
--add-opens javafx.graphics/com.sun.javafx.css=ALL-UNNAMED
--add-opens javafx.base/com.sun.javafx.runtime=ALL-UNNAMED
--add-exports javafx.controls/com.sun.javafx.scene.control.behavior=ALL-UNNAMED
--add-exports javafx.graphics/com.sun.javafx.scene.traversal=ALL-UNNAMED
