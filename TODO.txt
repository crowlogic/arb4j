Zoom/Magnify - OpenGL 3d surface rendering
-------------

When Z is pressed there is an indicator that zoom box
selection mode has been activated.

Press esc to exit zoom selection mode
click selects point
click selects the second point which causes the graph
to be replotted from the specified coordinates.
If esc is pressed after the 1st point is clicked, it goes
back to selection mode, if esc is pressed again it exits
zoom selection mode
