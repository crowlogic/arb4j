* modify MultivariateDiffusionProcessIntegrator to use Real
getCorrelation(int i, int j) to generate the white noises it uses to
perform the integrations
  
* foreign API: custom mapped memory segment factories instead of JNI DirectByteBuffers to alleviate the problems preventing large animations from being rendered within a single JVM

* use confined ResourceScopes in Java to implement constant Real,
Float, and Complex objects that throw exceptions if attemps to modify
them are made .. it uses kernel level page signalling to detect.. very
cool

* harness reflection symmetry to accelerate rendering 

* implement Lemniscate elliptic functions 

* algebraic expression parser, evaluator and compiler

* use ErrorFunction to correct the numerically integrated Fourier transforms


* parallelize ComplexFunction.integrate

* fullscreen mode for ComplexFunctionRenderer

* replace usage of Utilities#heapUp and heapDown with MemoryStack

* homotopy API 

* refine the SWIG definitions so that the pointers to pointers in RealMatrix and ComplexMatrix are handled optimally and without ugly code

* fix ParallelTransporter crash: free(): double free detected in tcache

* Transfer operator API

* port Real root-finding API to Complex values

* Scale/Rotate/Translate as Part of JPlotter/OpenGL renovation 

* 3d protein model

* orthogonal polynomial API

* implement (inter-host) distributed processing 

* Shape Operator

* API for plane curve Curvature

* Koenig linearization - SchroederFunctional And InverseSeries

* Add color-wheel legend to ComplexFunctionPlotter by adding another BufferedImage to be blended, and allow the ability to move them about dynamically via the mouse



Zoom/Magnify
-------------

When Z is pressed there is an indicator that zoom box
selection mode has been activated.

Press esc to exit zoom selection mode
click selects point
click selects the second point which causes the graph
to be replotted from the specified coordinates.
If esc is pressed after the 1st point is clicked, it goes
back to selection mode, if esc is pressed again it exits
zoom selection mode
