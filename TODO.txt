* implement numerically integrated Fourier transform
* intermittent SineFunctionTest failure.. one of the constants is
getting over-written... implement lock() method with mprotect()

* Fast Fourier Transform API
* use ErrorFunction to correct the numerically integrated Fourier transforms
* fix remaining memory leaks
