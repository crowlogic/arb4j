Deeper architectural fix (for issue #871 long-term): Investigate whether FunctionalEvaluationNode.type() should return the function's codomain type (Complex) rather than the function interface type (ComplexFunction) when the node represents a fully-applied function call (i.e., all arguments supplied). This would eliminate the need for many Function ÷ scalar type mappings entirely, as the existing scalar type mappings would apply. However, this change requires careful testing against all existing expression compilation paths, particularly those involving partial application and functional composition, to ensure no regressions.
debug ComplexFunctionTest.testSequence2
constant subexpression extraction
move intermediateVariableCounters from Context to Expression
#844: assert consistency between independent, indeterminate, and context variable namespaces
#859: Add null checks in initialize() for ascendent input variable fields propagated to subfunctions
the generated toString() of the Expression.generateFunctionalElement() method should show the value instead of the variable name if it is declared in an upstream expression (in which case the value is known)
standardize the Expression parser exception output message string
