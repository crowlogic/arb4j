compiler: implement ∂/∂x[∏ᵢ₌₁ᵏfᵢ(x)] = ∑ᵢ₌₁ᵏ[(∂/∂x fᵢ(x))∏ⱼ₌₁,ⱼ≠ᵢᵏfⱼ(x)]
compiler: SphericalBesselFunction functional bug #581
compiler: move expression evaluation that doesnt depend on input to the evaluate method to the initialization method #567
compiler: implement caching #555
compiler: implement switching of order-of-integration via Fubini's or Tonelli's theorem #549
api: implement orthogonal function sequence expansion api #546
compiler: Implement common subexpression elimination #518
api: Create Fractional Riccati Differential Equation Solver using Jacobi Tau Method #261
GaussianProcessSampler: add U&V to charts
GaussianProcessSampler: replace remaining double usage with Reals
GaussianProcessSampler: add ability to edit the random white noise measure and see the results of it in real time by resampling (involves the availability of hooks or making a plugni for ChartFX most likely)
GaussianProcessSampler: add ComplexDataSet and modify the GaussianProcessSampler to use it instead of two separate RealDataSets as it presently does
