java.lang.IllegalStateException: Caputo derivative exponent variable 'α' has no bounds set. Set bounds via setBounds() so that n = ⌈α⌉ can be resolved at compile time. Example: Real.named("α").set("0.5", 128).setBounds(0, false, 1, true)
implement Context merge-rename
debug ComplexFunctionTest.testSequence2
constant subexpression extraction
move intermediateVariableCounters from Context to Expression
#844: assert consistency between independent, indeterminate, and context variable namespaces
#859: Add null checks in initialize() for ascendent input variable fields propagated to subfunctions
the generated toString() of the Expression.generateFunctionalElement() method should show the value instead of the variable name if it is declared in an upstream expression (in which case the value is known)
standardize the Expression parser exception output message string
