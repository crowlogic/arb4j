expression compiler: implement caching #555
Expression Compiler: implement switching of order-of-integration via Fubini's or Tonelli's theorem #549
implement orthogonal function sequence expansion api #546
expr compiler: Implement common subexpression elimination #518
Create Fractional Riccati Differential Equation Solver using Jacobi Tau Method #261
RandomWaveSampler: add U&V to charts
GaussianProcessSampler: replace remaining double usage with Reals
compiler: move input-independent parts of the expression sub-tree into the initialize() method to avoid throwing away results of repeated calculations #567
LiteralConstantNode: replace linear search with hashmap     for (var existingConstant : expression.literalConstants.values())
implement ∂/∂x[∏ᵢ₌₁ᵏfᵢ(x)] = ∑ᵢ₌₁ᵏ[(∂/∂x fᵢ(x))∏ⱼ₌₁,ⱼ≠ᵢᵏfⱼ(x)]
#722: need to make sure that identity isnt used on a Scalar.. here in this case real.. it probably acts like the unknown variable is an indetrerminant rather than a variable taht the IntegralNode failed to rename/subst properly
recognize im(cos(I(*t))=0
