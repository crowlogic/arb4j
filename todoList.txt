oscillatory process inversion
completeness
Inverse filter to generate the stationary dilation process corresponding to a given oscillatory process.
Filter representation of oscillatory processes.

Cosmological speculation
Orthogonal random measures of Gaussian processes are projection-valued measures of the corresponding Hilbert spaces.
generated derivative method needst to have virtual bridge method created so it can return the specialized interface implementation rather than the generic Function interface
