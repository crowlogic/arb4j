all weakly harmonizable processes are oscillatory but the converse is only true if the gain function of the oscillator process does not depend on time
Both the No Boundary Proposal, related to the Hartle-Hawking wave function of the universe, and Alexey's reformulation of the Yang-Mills mass gap conjecture depend on the identification of the ground state in their respective Hilbert spaces. They both involve finding a measure on an infinite-dimensional space, which serves as a unifying factor between these theoretical frameworks. Both approaches aim to tackle fundamental questions in physics by exploring the properties of the underlying quantum state.
