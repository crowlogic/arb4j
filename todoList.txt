regarding OnThePrediction..pdf: this is the "square root" of the spectral density.. but its in theFourier-domain.. you donty literally take the square root of the kernel,rather, you take invert th foruier transform, to the th density, thentake its square root, then take the fourier transform to get back itothe time domain and that gives u the function that when convolved withitself gives the kernel
