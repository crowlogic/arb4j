debug ComplexFunctionTest.testSequence2
constant subexpression extraction
#844: assert consistency between independent, indeterminate, and context variable namespaces
support chained FunctionalEvaluationNodes such as a RealFunctionalSequence f then referred to by f(3)(2)(1)
#859: Add null checks in initialize() for ascendent input variable fields propagated to subfunctions
the generated toString() of the Expression.generateFunctionalElement() method should show the value instead of the variable name if it is declared in an upstream expression (in which case the value is known)
standardize the Expression parser exception output message string
move intermediateVariableCounters from Context to Expression
expressor: make it such that selecting a subset of the string and then clickign a character on the minisymbolpalette replaces the highlighted string
