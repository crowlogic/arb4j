SphericalBesselFunction functional bug #581
expression compiler optimization: move expression evaluation that doesnt depend on input to the evaluate method to the initialization method #567
expression compiler: implement caching #555
Expression Compiler: implement switching of order-of-integration via Fubini's or Tonelli's theorem #549
implement orthogonal function sequence expansion api #546

Create Fractional Riccati Differential Equation Solver using Jacobi Tau Method #261
RandomWaveSampler: add U&V to charts
GaussianProcessSampler: replace remaining double usage with Reals
GaussianProcessSampler: add ability to edit the random white noise measure and see the results of it in real time by resampling (involves the availability of hooks or making a plugni for ChartFX most likely)
