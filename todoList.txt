move intermediateVariableCounters from Context to Expression
debug ComplexFunctionTest.testSequence2
#844: assert consistency between independent, indeterminate, and context variable namespaces
#859: Add null checks in initialize() for ascendent input variable fields propagated to subfunctions
implement some sort of system of namespaces beyond Context
the generated toString() of the Expression.generateFunctionalElement() method should show the value instead of the variable name if it is declared in an upstream expression (in which case the value is known)
#758: implement Caputo fractional derivative for exponent in the unit interval
add up and down buttons to TODO that moves the currently selected line up or down so as to indicate priority
