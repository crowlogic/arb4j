implement derivative for function: lnΓ
implement ∂/∂x[∏ᵢ₌₁ᵏfᵢ(x)] = ∑ᵢ₌₁ᵏ[(∂/∂x fᵢ(x))∏ⱼ₌₁,ⱼ≠ᵢᵏfⱼ(x)]
SphericalBesselFunction functional bug #581
expression compiler: implement caching #555
Expression Compiler: implement switching of order-of-integration via Fubini's or Tonelli's theorem #549
implement orthogonal function sequence expansion api #546
expr compiler: Implement common subexpression elimination #518
Create Fractional Riccati Differential Equation Solver using Jacobi Tau Method #261
RandomWaveSampler: add U&V to charts
GaussianProcessSampler: replace remaining double usage with Reals
GaussianProcessSampler: add ability to edit the random white noise measure and see the results of it in real time by resampling (involves the availability of hooks or making a plugni for ChartFX most likely)
compiler: move input-independent parts of the expression sub-tree into the initialize() method to avoid throwing away results of repeated calculations #567
// TODO: need to generate instructions so that the toString() uses String.format to include the value (only if it was part of the independent variable because thats the only timneits fixed for the whole class, if its just a Context variable then it can  change between invocations
LiteralConstantNode: replace linear search with hashmap     for (var existingConstant : expression.literalConstants.values())
