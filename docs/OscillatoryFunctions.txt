Theorem (Existence of the Oscillatory Process: Integrability Condition for the Gain and Oscillatory Function)

Let (Ω, 𝒜, μ) be a σ-finite measure space, and let Φ be a complex-valued orthogonal random measure with second moment measure μ. Consider the gain function

    A : ℝ × Ω → ℂ

that is measurable in each variable and define, for each t ∈ ℝ, the oscillatory function

    φₜ(ω) = A(t, ω) e^{iωt}.

The process

    Xₜ = ∫_Ω φₜ(ω) dΦ(ω)

exists for each fixed t ∈ ℝ if and only if φₜ(ω) is quadratically integrable with respect to μ for that t, that is,

    ∫_Ω |φₜ(ω)|² dμ(ω) < ∞.

Equivalently, for fixed t, the gain function ω ↦ A(t, ω) must be square-integrable with respect to μ:

    ∫_Ω |A(t, ω)|² dμ(ω) < ∞.

This condition is immediate and exact: for all t and ω,

    |φₜ(ω)|² = |A(t, ω)|²,

because |e^{iωt}| = 1 for all real ω, t. Thus, if

    ∫_Ω |A(t, ω)|² dμ(ω) < ∞

then φₜ(ω) is integrable, and the process Xₜ is well-defined.

Proof.

The measurability of A in each variable ensures that φₜ(ω) = A(t, ω) e^{iωt} is measurable in ω for each fixed t. Consider the computation

    |φₜ(ω)|² = |A(t, ω)|² |e^{iωt}|² = |A(t, ω)|².

Therefore

    ∫_Ω |φₜ(ω)|² dμ(ω) = ∫_Ω |A(t, ω)|² dμ(ω).

The existence of the stochastic integral

    Xₜ = ∫_Ω φₜ(ω) dΦ(ω)

requires φₜ ∈ L²(Ω, μ), which is precisely the square-integrability of A(t, ·) with respect to μ. The condition

    ∫_Ω |A(t, ω)|² dμ(ω) < ∞

is both necessary and sufficient for defining Xₜ for a fixed t.
