Give a one paragraph concise version of the answer

A measurable modification of a stochastic process is a version of the process that is jointly measurable with respect to time and the probability space, and agrees with the original process at each fixed time almost surely; this ensures the process can be integrated over time and used in Fubini-type arguments, as the map $$(t,\omega) \mapsto X_t(\omega)$$ is measurable on the product space [1][2][3].
