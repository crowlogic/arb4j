regarding automatic differentation,

Speaking of differentiation and arb, what about 'automatic' or
'algorithmic' differentiation? If it is implemented it could be better
than finite differences but worse than custom coded derivatives of
functions.

Automatic differentiation is just power series arithmetic, which Arb
already supports for most of its functions. Theta function derivatives
will be done the same way.
