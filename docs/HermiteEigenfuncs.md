This is a great discussion of the deep connections between the Hermite
polynomials, the Fourier transform, and the quantum harmonic oscillator
in quantum mechanics. Let me summarize the key points:

1\. The Hermite polynomials $H_n (x)$ are eigenfunctions of the Fourier
transform operator $\mathcal{F}$, satisfying:
$$\mathcal{F} [H_n (x)] = (i^n) \cdot H_n (k)$$ where $i$ is the
imaginary unit, $n$ is the order of the polynomial, and $k$ is the
frequency domain variable. The eigenvalues are $(i^n)$.

2\. For the quantum harmonic oscillator, the position space wave
functions are given by:
$$\psi_n (x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2^n \cdot n! \cdot \sqrt{\pi}}} \cdot H_n (x)
  \cdot e^{- x^2 / 2}$$ Taking the Fourier transform, the momentum space
wave functions are:
$$\phi_n (p) = (i^n) \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{2^n \cdot n! \cdot \sqrt{\pi}}}
  \cdot H_n (p) \cdot e^{- p^2 / 2}$$ The Hermite polynomials enable an
elegant transition between position and momentum space.

3\. The kernel $K (x, x')$ of the integral form of the Schrödinger
equation $$\psi (x) = \int K (x, x') \cdot \psi (x') dx'$$ is related to
the Green's function $G (x, x' ; E)$ of the Schrödinger equation by:
$$K (x, x') = \sum_n \psi_n (x) \cdot \psi^{\ast}_n (x') = \int G (x, x' ; E)
  \cdot dE$$ where $E$ is the energy. The Green's function satisfies:
$$- \frac{\hbar^2}{2 m} \cdot \frac{d^2 G}{dx^2} + V (x) \cdot G (x, x' ; E) -
  E \cdot G (x, x' ; E) = \delta (x - x')$$ 4. The Green's function can
be viewed as the derivative of the kernel $K$ with respect to the energy
parameter $E$, treated as a Lebesgue-Stieltjes measure:
$$\frac{dK (x, x')}{dE} = G (x, x' ; E)$$ This reflects how the Green's
function filters the contribution to the propagation amplitude from a
specific energy.

In conclusion, the Fourier transform properties of the Hermite
polynomials play a crucial role in connecting the position and momentum
space pictures in the quantum harmonic oscillator problem. The kernel
and Green's function provide integral equation and source function
perspectives on the Schrödinger equation and are also intimately related
through the energy spectrum. These connections highlight the rich
mathematical structure underlying this fundamental quantum system.
