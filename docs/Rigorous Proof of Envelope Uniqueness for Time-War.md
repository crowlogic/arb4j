# Rigorous Proof of Envelope Uniqueness for Time-Warped Stationary Processes

This report provides a careful, step-by-step mathematical proof that every time-warped stationary process—defined as \$ Y(t) = X(\theta(t)) \$, where \$ X \$ is a stationary stochastic process and \$ \theta \$ is a strictly monotonically increasing function—admits a **unique envelope**, as defined using the analytic signal approach. The argument demonstrates that this uniqueness follows from the well-established envelope uniqueness for stationary processes and the bijective nature of the time-warping transformation.

## Executive Summary

We prove that for a time-warped stationary process \$ Y(t) = X(\theta(t)) \$, where \$ X \$ has a unique envelope and \$ \theta \$ is strictly monotonic (hence invertible), \$ Y \$ also exhibits a unique envelope. This is achieved by showing that any envelope defined for \$ Y \$ uniquely corresponds to the (unique) envelope for \$ X \$ through the coordinate transformation, and the potential for ambiguity is precluded by the strict monotonicity (injectivity) of \$ \theta \$. Thus, the class of all such time-warped stationary processes possesses unique envelopes.

## Introduction

Envelope analysis is fundamental in signal processing and stochastic process theory, providing a way to characterize the amplitude modulation of oscillatory processes. For stationary processes, the existence and uniqueness of such envelopes are well-established through the Hilbert transform and analytic signal theory. When the process is non-stationary due to time warping, the question of envelope uniqueness is more subtle. Here, we formalize and prove that under a strictly monotonic time-warping, uniqueness is preserved.

## Mathematical Framework

### Stationary Process and Envelope

Let \$ \{ X(\tau), \tau \in \mathbb{R} \} \$ be a real-valued, zero-mean, second-order stationary stochastic process. The envelope \$ R_X(\tau) \$ is defined via the analytic signal:

$$
X^a(\tau) = X(\tau) + i\hat{X}(\tau)
$$

where \$ \hat{X} \$ is the Hilbert transform of \$ X \$. The envelope is:

$$
R_X(\tau) = |X^a(\tau)| = \sqrt{X^2(\tau) + \hat{X}^2(\tau)}
$$

It is well-known (see e.g. Papoulis, Signal Analysis) that this envelope is unique (up to phase conventions that do not affect amplitude).

### Time-Warping

Let \$ \theta: \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R} \$ be a strictly monotonically increasing (injective, continuous, and invertible) function. The time-warped process is:

$$
Y(t) = X(\theta(t))
$$

We study the uniqueness of the envelope for \$ Y(t) \$.

### Envelope of Time-Warped Process

Analogously, we define the quadrature (Hilbert transform) process for \$ Y \$ as:

$$
\hat{Y}(t) := \hat{X}(\theta(t))
$$

which is justified since \$ \theta(t) \$ is invertible and continuous.

The envelope for \$ Y \$ is then:

$$
R_Y(t) = \sqrt{ Y^2(t) + \hat{Y}^2(t) } = \sqrt{ X^2(\theta(t)) + \hat{X}^2(\theta(t)) } = R_X(\theta(t))
$$

We must show that any attempt to define a different envelope for \$ Y \$ would contradict the uniqueness of the envelope for \$ X \$.

## Detailed Proof of Envelope Uniqueness

### Assumptions and Notation

- \$ X \$ is second-order stationary, real-valued, and admits a unique envelope \$ R_X \$.
- \$ \theta \$ is strictly monotonically increasing; thus, \$ \theta \$ is invertible with inverse \$ \tau = \theta(t) \$ and \$ t = \theta^{-1}(\tau) \$.
- All Hilbert transforms and related operations are well-defined (i.e., the necessary regularity conditions on \$ X \$ apply).


### Step 1: Uniqueness of Envelope for Stationary Process \$ X \$

By standard theory, if a real-valued stationary process \$ X \$ has a unique Hilbert transform \$ \hat{X} \$, the envelope \$ R_X(\tau) \$ defined via the modulus of the analytic signal is unique. For all \$ \tau \$, \$ R_X(\tau) \$ is uniquely determined by \$ X \$.

### Step 2: Construction of Envelope for \$ Y \$ via Coordinate Transformation

Given \$ Y(t) = X(\theta(t)) \$, any well-defined quadrature process for \$ Y \$ must be of the form \$ \hat{Y}(t) = \hat{X}(\theta(t)) \$, since the Hilbert transform commutes with coordinate shift under monotonic invertible maps. Thus, the corresponding analytic signal for \$ Y(t) \$ is:

$$
Y^a(t) = Y(t) + i\hat{Y}(t) = X(\theta(t)) + i\hat{X}(\theta(t)) = X^a(\theta(t))
$$

Therefore, the envelope is

$$
R_Y(t) = |Y^a(t)| = |X^a(\theta(t))| = R_X(\theta(t))
$$

### Step 3: Uniqueness via Contradiction

Suppose there exist two (possibly different) envelope definitions for \$ Y \$:

$$
R_{Y,1}(t) \neq R_{Y,2}(t)
$$

Define the corresponding "pullback" functions to \$ X \$ by:

$$
\tilde{R}_{X,1}(\tau) := R_{Y,1}(\theta^{-1}(\tau)), \quad 
\tilde{R}_{X,2}(\tau) := R_{Y,2}(\theta^{-1}(\tau))
$$

Since \$ t \mapsto \tau = \theta(t) \$ is invertible and covers \$ \mathbb{R} \$, both \$ \tilde{R}_{X,j}(\tau) \$ are valid envelope definitions for \$ X \$:

For all \$ \tau \in \mathbb{R} \$,

$$
\left(\tilde{R}_{X,j}(\tau)\right)^2 = \left(X(\tau)\right)^2 + \left(\hat{X}(\tau)\right)^2
$$

But by uniqueness,

$$
\tilde{R}_{X,1}(\tau) = \tilde{R}_{X,2}(\tau)
$$

for all \$ \tau \$, which implies

$$
R_{Y,1}(t) = R_{Y,2}(t) \quad \forall t
$$

Thus, the envelope for \$ Y \$ is unique.

### Step 4: Measurability and Regularity

Since \$ \theta \$ is a measurable bijection (from monotonicity), and all relevant processes are measurable, the composition and pullback operations are valid. The proof hinges critically on the **injectivity** of \$ \theta \$; if \$ \theta \$ were non-monotonic, this would break down (see previous discussion).

### Step 5: Application to General Time-Warped Stationary Processes

The argument above is general for any strictly monotonic, continuous \$ \theta \$, and for any stationary \$ X \$ for which Hilbert transforms are well-defined and envelopes unique (which is standard). Thus, **the entire class of time-warped stationary processes generated in this way admits unique envelopes, and the explicit formula is \$ R_Y(t) = R_X(\theta(t)) \$**.

## Comparison to Traditional and Other Nonstationary Processes

For nonstationary processes not arising from injective time warping of stationary processes, envelope uniqueness can fail: the existence of multiple time indices mapping to the same "warped" time would make the correspondence between process and envelope ambiguous. This is why **monotonicity—and thus injectivity—is essential**.

## Physical and Mathematical Implications

This result reveals a deep structural property: **envelope uniqueness is preserved under invertible transformations of the time axis**, provided the original process enjoys this property. It establishes a mathematically robust class larger than just stationary or transient processes as considered by Hasofer.

## Conclusion

We have rigorously **proved that every time-warped stationary process of the form \$ Y(t) = X(\theta(t)) \$ with strictly increasing \$ \theta \$ admits a unique envelope**, given by \$ R_Y(t) = R_X(\theta(t)) \$. This is a direct consequence of:

1. Uniqueness of the envelope for stationary \$ X \$.
2. The injectivity and invertibility of the time-warping transformation \$ \theta \$.
3. The ability to "pull back" and "push forward" envelope definitions through the time-warp.

Thus, **the class of time-warped stationary processes defined in this way possesses unique envelopes**. This result is sharp—the monotonicity (injectivity) assumption cannot be relaxed without destroying uniqueness.
