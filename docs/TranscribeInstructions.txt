transcribe this pdf into a latex document format coming as close to as possible as capturing all the content exactly as is, but do use label tags and reference tags instead of hardcoding references,make sure each equation has a line number if it appears as a full-line equation regardless of whether or not it is referenced, also use enumeration tags instead of blindly repeating enumerated things, and also use the theorem and proof tags instead of just repeating the text raw, put the whole thing in a complete latex document start to finisb in a code block. i said dont fucking hard coded referneces, that measns DO NOT EVER WRITE (1) use a fuclking tag instead!. DO NOT HARD CODE REFERENCES TO SHIT IN THE BIBLIOGRAPHJY., FUCKING USE THE APPROPRIATE TAGS, BRING AS MUCH STRUCFTURE AND FUCKING ORDER TO THE DOCUMENT AS POSSIBLE WITHOUT LOSING INFORMATION
