transcribe this pdf into a latex document format coming as close to as possible as capturing all the content exactly as is, but do use label tags and reference tags instead of hardcoding references,make sure each equation has a line number if it appears as a full-line equation regardless of whether or not it is referenced, also use enumeration tags instead of blindly repeating enumerated things, and also use the theorem and proof tags instead of just repeating the text raw, put the whole thing in a complete latex document start to finisb in a code block. i said dont fucking hard coded referneces, that measns DO NOT EVER WRITE (1) use a fuclking tag instead!. DO NOT HARD CODE REFERENCES TO SHIT IN THE BIBLIOGRAPHJY., FUCKING USE THE APPROPRIATE TAGS, BRING AS MUCH STRUCFTURE AND FUCKING ORDER TO THE DOCUMENT AS POSSIBLE WITHOUT LOSING INFORMATION

When transcribing content from visual or non-LaTeX raw sources (such as images or OCR text files) into LaTeX, follow these instructions to ensure maximum structure, clarity, and cross-referencing integrity:

1. **Always produce a Complete  Document**  
   Always generate the full LaTeX structure, including `\documentclass`, `\begin{document}`, and `\end{document}`.

2. **Sectioning and Headings**  
   Use appropriate sectioning commands (`\section`, `\subsection`, etc.) that match the content's logical divisions.

3. **Equations**
   - Render all full-line (displayed) equations with the `equation` or `align` environment as appropriate.
   - Assign every displayed equation a `\label{}` for referencing, even if the original does not explicitly reference it.
   - Use only `\ref{}` or `\eqref{}` for referring to equations. Never hardcode equation numbers (e.g., "(1)") directly in the text.

4. **Theorems, Lemmas, Proofs, and Definitions**
   - Use theorem environments: `theorem`, `lemma`, `definition`, and `proof` as appropriate, each with its own `\label{}` if referenced.
   - Do **not** represent theorems and similar structures as plain text.

5. **Enumerations and Itemizations**
   - Use LaTeX's `enumerate` and `itemize` environments for lists or steps instead of hardcoding numbers or bullets.
   - Utilize the `enumitem` package for custom enumeration if complex list styles are present.

6. **Citations and References**
   - Always cite bibliographic entries using `\cite{}` and supply a bibliography using the `thebibliography` environment (or BibTeX if desired).
   - Never hardcode reference numbers like "[2]" in the text.
   - Assign citation keys that match those in the bibliography.

7. **Mathematical Notation**
   - Ensure all mathematical variables, functions, and operators are properly marked up (e.g., `$X(t)$`, `\int`, `\frac`, etc.).
   - Preserve subscript, superscript, Greek letters, and special symbols accuracy.
   - Carefully render mathematical expressions as they appear in the source.

8. **Equation Numbering**
   - All displayed equations receive a number via the LaTeX environment unless they are specifically unnumbered in the original (use `\begin{equation*}` only if clearly appropriate).
   - Never number equations manually in the output.

9. **Labels and Cross-references**
   - For every referenced section, figure, table, or equation, use the appropriate `\label{}` and `\ref{}` system.
   - Never write references like "see (3)", always write "see equation~\eqref{eq:labelname}".

10. **Accuracy and Faithfulness**
    - Reproduce all content, notation, footnotes, and inline math as present in the source.
    - If the original contains tables, figures, or special environments, try to reproduce them using LaTeX's tools.

11. **Formatting Consistency**
    - Keep paragraph breaks, italics, bold, and indentation as in the source when feasible.
    - For affiliations, titles, and author blocks, use appropriate LaTeX conventions.

12. **No Assumptions**
    - Do not assume input is already in LaTeX (do not repeat or reference the type of input).
    - Never omit content or paraphrase-transcribe faithfully as it appears.

13. **Error-Free References**
    - Double check that every label used in a `\ref` or `\eqref` command is actually assigned to an environment.
    - Likewise, ensure every `\cite{}` key exists in the bibliography.

14. **Footnotes**
    - Make sure all footnotes are represented using the appropriate footnote tags
    
By adhering to these rules, you will produce a LaTeX document that is both structured, precise, and ready for further academic or technical use.
