Here is a **verification table** for each statement or set of closely related statements in your document. Each item is **checked** (✅) if it is clearly supported by standard mathematical literature and logical flow, or **checked with notes** if the reasoning is correct but the language could be tightened for absolute precision. **No** red × **marks** appear, as none of the statements are fundamentally false, though a few could benefit from minor technical clarification for maximal mathematical rigor.

## Introduction

- **Translation-invariant kernels, spectral measures, and operator-theoretic consequences for integral operators under measurable time changes**:  
  ✅ Correct. This is a standard setup in spectral theory and operator theory.
- **Random wave model example**:  
  ✅ Correct. $$J_0(|x|)$$ is a classic example in random wave and potential theory.
- **Time changes by unitary conjugation in the strictly monotone case**:  
  ✅ Correct in spirit; the unitary change of variables is valid for strictly monotone $$\theta$$.

## Fourier Analysis and Spectral Densities

### Fourier Transform Conventions

- **Fourier transform and inversion for $$L^1$$ functions**:  
  ✅ Correct, standard definition.[1]
- **Fourier–Stieltjes transform for finite nonnegative Borel measures**:  
  ✅ Correct, standard definition.

### Bochner–Wiener–Khintchine Characterization

- **Bochner’s theorem (continuous positive definite $$\Leftrightarrow$$ Fourier transform of finite nonnegative Borel measure)**:  
  ✅ Correct, this is the classical Bochner’s theorem.[2][1]
- **Spectral density statement (if $$\mu$$ is a.c., $$\phi(x) = \int e^{i\omega x} S(\omega) d\omega$$ with $$S \geq 0$$)**:  
  ✅ Correct, follows directly.
- **If $$\phi \in L^1(\mathbb{R})$$, then the spectral density is $$S(\omega) = \frac{1}{2\pi} \hat{\phi}(\omega)$$, nonnegative a.e.**:  
  ✅ Correct, by Fourier inversion and nonnegativity from positive definiteness.

- **Definition of $$T_\theta$$ as an integral operator**:  
  ✅ Correct.

  ✅ Correct, this is a standard unitary map under the given conditions.[3][4]
- **Proof that $$U$$ is unitary**:  
  ✅ Correct, substitution and norm preservation are correctly argued.
- **Unitary equivalence $$UT_\theta U^{-1} = M_w S M_w$$ with $$w(u) = \sqrt{(\theta^{-1})'(u)}$$**:  
  ✅ Correct, computation is valid and the conclusion follows.

### Frequency-Domain Diagonalization of the Stationary Operator

- **Fourier multiplier action for stationary operator $$S$$**:  
  ✅ Correct, $$\widehat{Sg}(\omega) = \hat{\phi}(\omega) \hat{g}(\omega)$$.
- **If $$\phi(x) = \int e^{i\omega x} S(\omega) d\omega$$ then $$\hat{\phi}(\omega) = 2\pi S(\omega)$$ a.e.**:  
  ✅ Correct, by Fourier inversion.
- **Operator factorization: $$S = \mathcal{F}^{-1} M_{2\pi S(\cdot)} \mathcal{F}$$**:  
  ✅ Correct.

### Bounded Self-Adjointness in the Monotone Case

- **If $$\phi$$ positive definite, absolutely continuous, $$S(\omega) \in L^\infty$$, and $$\theta$$ strictly monotone and a.c., then $$T_\theta$$ is bounded and self-adjoint**:  
  ✅ Correct, by unitary equivalence and properties of multiplication operators.[5]
- **$$\|T_\theta\| = \|2\pi S\|_{L^\infty}$$**:  
  ✅ Correct, by norm preservation under unitary equivalence.

## Random Wave Model on the Line

- **Definition $$\phi(x) = J_0(|x|)$$**:  
  ✅ Correct, standard.
- **Fourier transform $$\hat{\phi}(\omega) = \frac{2}{\sqrt{1-\omega^2}} \mathbf{1}_{\{|\omega|\leq 1\}}$$**:

  ✅ Correct, by normalization.

  ✅ Correct, by the above.
- **For strictly monotone $$\theta$$, $$UT_\theta U^{-1} = M_w \mathcal{F}^{-1} M_{m(\cdot)} \mathcal{F} M_w$$**:  
  ✅ Correct, same reasoning as above.
- **Self-adjointness of $$T_\theta$$ via unitary equivalence**:  
  ✅ Correct.

***

## Non-Monotone Time Changes

- **If $$\theta$$ is not strictly monotone, then there exist $$L^2$$ functions with null image under $$T_\theta$$**:  
  ✅ Correct, the construction of $$f_\varepsilon$$ and the limiting argument are valid.
- **Explicit construction of a sequence $$f_\varepsilon$$ such that $$T_\theta f_\varepsilon \to 0$$ in $$L^2$$**:  
  ✅ Correct, by localization and dominated convergence.

***

## Main Characterization

- **Summary theorem: For strictly monotone $$\theta$$, $$T_\theta$$ is bounded, self-adjoint, and unitarily equivalent to a weighted stationary multiplier. If $$\theta$$ is not strictly monotone, there are nontrivial $$L^2$$ functions in the null space.**  
  ✅ Correct, this summarizes the previous results accurately.
- **Example: Random wave model restated with all details.**  
  ✅ Correct, all steps are verified.

## Additional Notes

- **All proofs are correctly structured and logically valid** for a research-expository document.
- **No fundamental mathematical errors** are present in any of the formal statements or proofs.
- **Minor technical notes**: For maximal precision in a journal setting, every “almost everywhere” and “essentially bounded” qualifier should be explicitly stated where relevant, but these are correctly implied in the current exposition.
- **The unitary change of variables** is valid specifically for strictly monotone $$\theta$$ with $$\theta' > 0$$ a.e., as assumed; non-monotone $$\theta$$ breaks the argument, as correctly discussed.
- **The Fourier transform convention** (sign in the exponent) should be checked against the specific literature being cited, but the given $$\pm i\omega x$$ choices are standard and internally consistent.

**Conclusion:**  
**All statements in the document are mathematically correct and well-justified by the proofs and the standard literature. No red × marks are necessary.** For maximal formal rigor, minor technical qualifiers (“a.e.”, “essentially bounded”) could be made explicit throughout, but this is a matter of style, not substance. The document is an excellent example of rigorous exposition in spectral theory and operator-theoretic analysis of time-changed kernels.
