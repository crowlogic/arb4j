1. Introduction

Let 

Z(t)=∫ϕₜ(λ)dΦ(λ) 

be a realization of an oscillatory process(as defined by Priestly) where
Φ(λ) is a complex orthogonal random measure and 

ϕₜ(λ)=exp(i*t*λ)*Aₜ(λ)

is the oscillatory function where Aₜ(λ) is an invertible complex-valued 
gain-function which determines the time-varying spectral characteristics 
of the process by modulating both the magnitude and phase of the underlying 
stationary process which gives rise to the oscillatory kernel

K(t,s)=∫ϕₜ(λ)ϕₛ(λ)dμ(λ)
      =∫exp(i*t*λ)*Aₜ(λ)conj(exp(i*s*λ)*Aₛ(λ))dμ(λ)
      =∫exp(i*t*λ)*Aₜ(λ)exp(-i*s*λ)*conj(Aₛ(λ))dμ(λ)
      =∫exp(i*(t-s)*λ)*Aₜ(λ)*conj(Aₛ(λ))dμ(λ)
      =∫exp(i*(t-s)*λ)*Aₜ(λ)*conj(Aₛ(λ))S(λ)dλ
      
resulting in an evolutionary spectrum where μ(λ) is the spectral measure of 
the complex orthogonal random measure Φ(λ) which will be taken to be absolutely
continuous so that the spectral density S(λ) is given by the its derivative

S(λ)=d/dλ(μ(λ)) 

2. Theorem: Injective Time Changes of Stationary Gaussian Processes Yield Oscillatory Processes with Explicit Zero-Crossing Count

Let X(t) be a real, zero-mean, stationary Gaussian process with spectral density S(λ).
Let θ(t) be a strictly monotonically increasing, differentiable function (injective time-change).
Define the time-changed process

    Z(t) = X(θ(t)).

Then:

(a) Z(t) is an oscillatory process in Priestley's sense, with oscillatory functions

        φₜ(λ) = exp(i λ θ(t))

    and gain function

        Aₜ(λ) = exp(i λ (θ(t) - t)).

(b) The covariance kernel of Z(t) is

        K(t, s) = ∫ exp(i (θ(t) - θ(s)) λ) S(λ) dλ.

(c) The expected number of zero crossings in (0, t) for Z(t) is

        E[N(0, t)] = ν * (θ(t) - θ(0))

    where ν = (1/π) * sqrt(λ₂/λ₀) is the zero-crossing rate of X.

Proof

(1) Oscillatory Representation

Start with the spectral representation of X(t):

    X(t) = ∫ exp(i λ t) dΦ(λ).

Apply the time-change t ↦ θ(t):

    Z(t) = X(θ(t)) = ∫ exp(i λ θ(t)) dΦ(λ)
         = ∫ φₜ(λ) dΦ(λ)

with

    φₜ(λ) = exp(i λ θ(t)) = exp(i λ t) exp(i λ (θ(t) - t))
          = exp(i λ t) Aₜ(λ),

where

    Aₜ(λ) := exp(i λ (θ(t) - t)).

(2) Covariance Kernel

    E[Z(t) Z(s)] = E[X(θ(t)) X(θ(s))]
                 = K_X(θ(t) - θ(s))
                 = ∫ exp(i (θ(t) - θ(s)) λ) S(λ) dλ.

(3) Expected Zero-Crossing Count

Zero crossings of Z(u) for u ∈ (0, t) correspond to zero crossings of X(v) for v ∈ (θ(0), θ(t)), since θ is strictly monotonically increasing.

The expected number of zero crossings of X in (θ(0), θ(t)) is ν * (θ(t) - θ(0)).

Therefore:

    E[N(0, t)] = ν * (θ(t) - θ(0)).
