1. Introduction

Let 

Z(t)=∫ϕₜ(λ)dΦ(λ) 

be a realization of an oscillatory process(as defined by Priestly) where
Φ(λ) is a complex orthogonal random measure and 

ϕₜ(λ)=exp(i*t*λ)*Aₜ(λ)

is the oscillatory function where Aₜ(λ) is an invertible complex-valued 
gain-function which determines the time-varying spectral characteristics 
of the process by modulating both the magnitude and phase of the underlying 
stationary process which gives rise to the oscillatory kernel

K(t,s)=∫ϕₜ(λ)ϕₛ(λ)dμ(λ)
      =∫exp(i*t*λ)*Aₜ(λ)conj(exp(i*s*λ)*Aₛ(λ))dμ(λ)
      =∫exp(i*t*λ)*Aₜ(λ)exp(-i*s*λ)*conj(Aₛ(λ))dμ(λ)
      =∫exp(i*(t-s)*λ)*Aₜ(λ)*conj(Aₛ(λ))dμ(λ)
      =∫exp(i*(t-s)*λ)*Aₜ(λ)*conj(Aₛ(λ))S(λ)dλ
      
resulting in an evolutionary spectrum where μ(λ) is the spectral measure of 
the complex orthogonal random measure Φ(λ) which will be taken to be absolutely
continuous so that the spectral density S(λ) is given by the its derivative

S(λ)=d/dλ(μ(λ))
