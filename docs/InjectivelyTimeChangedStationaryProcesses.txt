1. Introduction

Let 

Z(t)=∫ψₜ(λ)dΨ(λ) 

be a realization of an oscillatory process(as defined by Priestly) where

ψₜ(λ) is the so-called oscillatory function defined by

ψₜ(λ)=exp(i*t*λ)*Aₜ(λ)

where Aₜ(λ) is the gain-function which determines the how the spectrum
of the process evolves over time; hence oscillatory processes are said
to have an evolutionary spectrum.
