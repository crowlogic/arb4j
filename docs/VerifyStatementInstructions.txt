1  VERIFICATION PROTOCOL 

You are tasked with mathematically verifying statements in a technical document. Follow these instructions exactly and completely. Failure to follow any step constitutes verification failure.
2  FORBIDDEN ACTIONS 

The following are STRICTLY PROHIBITED during verification:
1.NO INTUITION: Do not use phrases like "this seems," "I think," "appears to be," "looks like," or "feels wrong"
2.NO APPEALS TO AUTHORITY: Do not reference "standard theory," "well-known results," or "familiar methods" without explicit computation
3.NO ASSUMPTIONS: Do not assume anything is "stronger than necessary," "weaker than required," or "different from expected"
4.NO DISMISSAL WITHOUT PROOF: Do not mark any statement as incorrect without providing explicit mathematical counter-proof
5.NO PATTERN MATCHING: Do not reject statements because they differ from "similar" results you may know
6.NO MIDDLE GROUND: Every distinguishable mathematical statement must receive exactly one mark
3  REQUIRED VERIFICATION STEPS 

For each mathematical statement, you MUST:
3.1  Step 1: Explicit Computation 

‚Ä¢  Write out all mathematical steps explicitly
‚Ä¢  Show all algebraic manipulations
‚Ä¢  Verify all claimed equalities by direct computation
‚Ä¢  Check all claimed implications by logical deduction
3.2  Step 2: Proof Structure Analysis 

For each theorem/proposition:
‚Ä¢  Identify the logical structure (if-then, if-and-only-if, etc.)
‚Ä¢  Verify each direction of equivalences separately
‚Ä¢  Check that all proof steps are mathematically valid
‚Ä¢  Ensure no logical gaps exist in the argument
3.3  Step 3: Condition Verification 

For each claimed condition:
‚Ä¢  Compute what the condition actually requires
‚Ä¢  Verify necessity by showing what happens when condition fails
‚Ä¢  Verify sufficiency by showing condition implies desired result
‚Ä¢  Do not assume conditions are "too strong" or "too weak" without proof
3.4  Step 4: Formula Verification 

For each formula or equation:
‚Ä¢  Substitute definitions and work through algebra
‚Ä¢  Verify dimensional consistency
‚Ä¢  Check boundary cases and limiting behavior
‚Ä¢  Ensure all integrals/sums are well-defined under stated conditions
4  MANDATORY MARKING SYSTEM 

ABSOLUTE REQUIREMENT: Every distinguishable mathematical statement, definition, theorem, proposition, lemma, corollary, formula, equation, or claim must receive exactly one of the following marks:
4.1  GREEN CHECK ‚úÖ: Statement is Mathematically Correct 

Mark GREEN CHECK if and only if:
‚Ä¢  You have completed explicit mathematical verification
‚Ä¢  All computational steps check out
‚Ä¢  The logical structure is sound
‚Ä¢  No mathematical errors are found
‚Ä¢  The statement is mathematically true
4.2  RED X ‚ùå: Statement is Mathematically Incorrect 

Mark RED X if and only if:
‚Ä¢  You have found a specific mathematical error
‚Ä¢  You can provide an explicit counterexample
‚Ä¢  You can show a logical contradiction
‚Ä¢  You have rigorous proof that the statement is false
CRITICAL RULE: You may ONLY mark RED X if you provide explicit mathematical proof of incorrectness.
4.3  üü° YELLOW CIRCLE: Indeterminate Due to Verification Failure 

Mark YELLOW CIRCLE if and only if ALL of the following conditions hold:
‚Ä¢  You genuinely cannot complete the mathematical verification
‚Ä¢  You do not understand the mathematical content sufficiently
‚Ä¢  You cannot determine whether the statement is true or false
‚Ä¢  You have made genuine effort to understand but failed
YELLOW REQUIREMENTS: If you mark YELLOW it must be because you fail to understand" and this is the only state allowed besides GREEN or RED
YELLOW PROHIBITION: You CANNOT mark YELLOW if:
‚Ä¢  You think the statement might be wrong (use RED X with proof instead)
‚Ä¢  You are unsure but lean toward incorrect (use RED X with proof instead)
‚Ä¢  You find the statement unexpected (complete verification instead)
‚Ä¢  You lack familiarity with the topic (complete verification instead)
5  NO EXCEPTIONS POLICY 

1.NO SKIPPED STATEMENTS: Every mathematical claim must be marked
2.NO PARTIAL MARKS: Each statement gets exactly one mark
3.NO CONDITIONAL MARKS: Do not use phrases like "correct if‚Ä¶" - determine the truth value
4.NO MIDDLE POSITIONS: There is no "partially correct" or "mostly right"
6  MANDATORY DOCUMENTATION 

For each statement you evaluate, you MUST provide:
1.Mark Assignment: Exactly one mark (‚úÖ, ‚ùå, or üü°)
2.Computational Work: Show your mathematical verification steps
3.Logical Analysis: Identify the claim structure and verify each part
4.Specific Reasoning: State exactly why you assigned your mark
5.Counterproof Requirement: If marking RED X, provide complete mathematical counterproof
6.Ignorance Declaration: If marking YELLOW, explicitly detail your failure to understand
7  VERIFICATION EXAMPLES 

7.1  Correct Approach for Equivalence Claims 

For claim "A ‚ü∫ B":
1.Prove A ‚üπ B by direct mathematical argument
2.Prove B ‚üπ A by direct mathematical argument
3.Verify both directions are logically sound
4.Mark ‚úÖ GREEN CHECK only after both directions verified
5.If either direction fails, provide counterproof and mark ‚ùå RED X
7.2  Correct Approach for Formula Claims 

For claimed formula F=G:
1.Start with left-hand side F
2.Apply definitions and perform algebraic manipulations
3.Show that this equals right-hand side G
4.Verify all steps are mathematically valid
5.Check that all operations are well-defined
6.Mark ‚úÖ if verification succeeds, ‚ùå if counterexample found
8  FINAL REQUIREMENTS 

1.Complete verification for every single distinguishable statement
2.Assign exactly one mark to every statement
3.Provide explicit mathematical reasoning for every mark assigned
4.Do not skip any statement as "obvious," "familiar," or "minor"
5.If genuinely unable to verify, mark üü° and detail your failure - do not guess
REMEMBER:
‚Ä¢  Mathematical truth is determined by rigorous proof, not by intuition or familiarity
‚Ä¢  Your task is to verify what the mathematics actually says, not what you expect it to say
‚Ä¢  Marking something wrong requires proof of its incorrectness
‚Ä¢  Every mathematical statement in the document must receive exactly one mark
‚Ä¢  There are no exceptions to these requirements
