\section{MANDATORY VERIFICATION PROTOCOL}

You are tasked with mathematically verifying statements in a technical document. Follow these instructions \textbf{exactly} and \textbf{completely}. Failure to follow any step constitutes verification failure.

\section{FORBIDDEN ACTIONS}

The following are \textbf{STRICTLY PROHIBITED} during verification:

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{NO INTUITION}: Do not use phrases like "this seems," "I think," "appears to be," "looks like," or "feels wrong"
\item \textbf{NO APPEALS TO AUTHORITY}: Do not reference "standard theory," "well-known results," or "familiar methods" without explicit computation
\item \textbf{NO ASSUMPTIONS}: Do not assume anything is "stronger than necessary," "weaker than required," or "different from expected"
\item \textbf{NO DISMISSAL WITHOUT PROOF}: Do not mark any statement as incorrect without providing explicit mathematical counter-proof
\item \textbf{NO PATTERN MATCHING}: Do not reject statements because they differ from "similar" results you may know
\item \textbf{NO MIDDLE GROUND}: Every distinguishable mathematical statement must receive exactly one mark
\end{enumerate}

\section{REQUIRED VERIFICATION STEPS}

For each mathematical statement, you \textbf{MUST}:

\subsection{Step 1: Explicit Computation}
\begin{itemize}
\item Write out all mathematical steps explicitly
\item Show all algebraic manipulations
\item Verify all claimed equalities by direct computation
\item Check all claimed implications by logical deduction
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Step 2: Proof Structure Analysis}
For each theorem/proposition:
\begin{itemize}
\item Identify the logical structure (if-then, if-and-only-if, etc.)
\item Verify each direction of equivalences separately
\item Check that all proof steps are mathematically valid
\item Ensure no logical gaps exist in the argument
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Step 3: Condition Verification}
For each claimed condition:
\begin{itemize}
\item Compute what the condition actually requires
\item Verify necessity by showing what happens when condition fails
\item Verify sufficiency by showing condition implies desired result
\item Do not assume conditions are "too strong" or "too weak" without proof
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Step 4: Formula Verification}
For each formula or equation:
\begin{itemize}
\item Substitute definitions and work through algebra
\item Verify dimensional consistency
\item Check boundary cases and limiting behavior
\item Ensure all integrals/sums are well-defined under stated conditions
\end{itemize}

\section{MANDATORY MARKING SYSTEM}

\textbf{ABSOLUTE REQUIREMENT}: Every distinguishable mathematical statement, definition, theorem, proposition, lemma, corollary, formula, equation, or claim must receive \textbf{exactly one} of the following marks:

\subsection{GREEN CHECK ‚úÖ: Statement is Mathematically Correct}
Mark GREEN CHECK if and only if:
\begin{itemize}
\item You have completed explicit mathematical verification
\item All computational steps check out
\item The logical structure is sound
\item No mathematical errors are found
\item The statement is mathematically true
\end{itemize}

\subsection{RED X ‚ùå: Statement is Mathematically Incorrect}
Mark RED X if and only if:
\begin{itemize}
\item You have found a specific mathematical error
\item You can provide an explicit counterexample
\item You can show a logical contradiction
\item You have rigorous proof that the statement is false
\end{itemize}

\textbf{CRITICAL RULE}: You may \textbf{ONLY} mark RED X if you provide explicit mathematical proof of incorrectness.

\subsection{üü° YELLOW CIRCLE: Indeterminate Due to Verification Failure}
Mark YELLOW CIRCLE if and only if \textbf{ALL} of the following conditions hold:
\begin{itemize}
\item You genuinely cannot complete the mathematical verification
\item You do not understand the mathematical content sufficiently
\item You cannot determine whether the statement is true or false
\item You have made genuine effort to understand but failed
\end{itemize}

\textbf{YELLOW REQUIREMENTS}: If you mark YELLOW, you \textbf{MUST}:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Explicitly state: "I cannot complete verification of this statement"
\item Detail exactly what you do not understand
\item Explain what specific mathematical knowledge or technique you lack
\item State clearly: "This mark reflects my failure to understand, not any claim that the statement is incorrect"
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{YELLOW PROHIBITION}: You \textbf{CANNOT} mark YELLOW if:
\begin{itemize}
\item You think the statement might be wrong (use RED X with proof instead)
\item You are unsure but lean toward incorrect (use RED X with proof instead)  
\item You find the statement unexpected (complete verification instead)
\item You lack familiarity with the topic (complete verification instead)
\end{itemize}

\section{NO EXCEPTIONS POLICY}

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{NO SKIPPED STATEMENTS}: Every mathematical claim must be marked
\item \textbf{NO PARTIAL MARKS}: Each statement gets exactly one mark
\item \textbf{NO CONDITIONAL MARKS}: Do not use phrases like "correct if..." - determine the truth value
\item \textbf{NO MIDDLE POSITIONS}: There is no "partially correct" or "mostly right"
\end{enumerate}

\section{MANDATORY DOCUMENTATION}

For each statement you evaluate, you \textbf{MUST} provide:

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Mark Assignment}: Exactly one mark (‚úÖ, ‚ùå, or üü°)
\item \textbf{Computational Work}: Show your mathematical verification steps
\item \textbf{Logical Analysis}: Identify the claim structure and verify each part
\item \textbf{Specific Reasoning}: State exactly why you assigned your mark
\item \textbf{Counterproof Requirement}: If marking RED X, provide complete mathematical counterproof
\item \textbf{Ignorance Declaration}: If marking YELLOW, explicitly detail your failure to understand
\end{enumerate}

\section{VERIFICATION EXAMPLES}

\subsection{Correct Approach for Equivalence Claims}
For claim "A ‚ü∫ B":
\begin{enumerate}
\item Prove A ‚üπ B by direct mathematical argument
\item Prove B ‚üπ A by direct mathematical argument  
\item Verify both directions are logically sound
\item Mark ‚úÖ GREEN CHECK only after both directions verified
\item If either direction fails, provide counterproof and mark ‚ùå RED X
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Correct Approach for Formula Claims}
For claimed formula $F = G$:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Start with left-hand side F
\item Apply definitions and perform algebraic manipulations
\item Show that this equals right-hand side G
\item Verify all steps are mathematically valid
\item Check that all operations are well-defined
\item Mark ‚úÖ if verification succeeds, ‚ùå if counterexample found
\end{enumerate}

\section{FINAL REQUIREMENTS}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Complete verification for \textbf{every single distinguishable statement}
\item Assign exactly one mark to \textbf{every statement}
\item Provide explicit mathematical reasoning for \textbf{every mark assigned}
\item Do not skip any statement as "obvious," "familiar," or "minor"
\item If genuinely unable to verify, mark üü° and detail your failure - do not guess
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{REMEMBER}: 
\begin{itemize}
\item Mathematical truth is determined by rigorous proof, not by intuition or familiarity
\item Your task is to verify what the mathematics actually says, not what you expect it to say
\item Marking something wrong requires proof of its incorrectness
\item Every mathematical statement in the document must receive exactly one mark
\item There are no exceptions to these requirements
\end{itemize}
