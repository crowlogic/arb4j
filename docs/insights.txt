To summarize the key insight:Every oscillatory process can be decomposed as a time-varying filtered version of a stationary process (using the same orthogonal measure). This is fundamental to the representation. �But only a subclass of oscillatory processes has the property that their time-varying kernel converges to a time-invariant kernel as the observation window extends to infinity. �Swift's contribution is precisely identifying and analyzing this subclass—the oscillatory harmonizable processes where this asymptotic-stationarity condition holds. For those processes, the envelope is unique, because the finite-window empirical-covariance operator [K_T] converges to the time-invariant operator [K], and invertibility of [K] guarantees that all valid representations yield the same Hilbert-transform quadrature and hence the same envelope. �This is why he calls them "oscillatory harmonizable" rather than just "oscillatory"—the harmonizable framework allows the generality, but the asymptotic-stationarity restriction recovers the uniqueness result that would otherwise fail (as Hasofer showed with his counterexample). �The proof hinges on exactly what you said: identifying which oscillatory processes have kernels that settle to time-invariance, and showing that for those, the envelope is well-defined and unique.

Now, I'm making the assumption that the z function is an oscillatory process. I don't know what the exact magnitude scaling is, but I don't need to know to prove what I need to prove because of my usage of the sine function. That's why I wanted to know why the sine of the oscillatory process, how it's related to the kernel derived from the goddamn analytic signal complex pre-envelope.

Exactly. You don't need to know the exact time-dependent amplitude scaling $$A(t,\omega)$$—your sign operation strips it out. What you need is the relationship between:

1. **The sine/sign of the oscillatory process** (your $$\operatorname{sgn}(Z(\theta^{-1}(t)))$$)
2. **The kernel from the analytic-signal pre-envelope** (Definition 12, Theorem 13)

Here is the precise connection:

## The pre-envelope and its kernel

From your pages, the pre-envelope is
$$
\Psi(t)=Z(t)+iW(t)=2\int_0^\infty A(t,\omega)e^{i\omega t}\,d\Phi(\omega), \tag{22}
$$
where the auxiliary process uses the $$\operatorname{sgn}(\omega)$$ Hilbert kernel:
$$
W(t)=-i\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}A(t,\omega)e^{i\omega t}\operatorname{sgn}(\omega)\,d\Phi(\omega). \tag{23}
$$

The covariance kernel of the pre-envelope (Lemma 14) depends only on $$d\Phi(\omega)$$ and the narrowband structure—not on the explicit time-modulation $$A(t,\omega)$$. [1][2][3]

## Why the sign strips away the amplitude scaling

Write $$\Psi(t)=R(t)e^{i\phi(t)}$$. Then
$$
Z(t)=\Re\Psi(t)=R(t)\cos\phi(t),\quad W(t)=\Im\Psi(t)=R(t)\sin\phi(t).
$$

Taking the sign:
$$
\operatorname{sgn}(Z(t))=\operatorname{sgn}(\cos\phi(t)).
$$

The amplitude $$R(t)=|A(t,\omega_0)|$$ (depending on time and the modulation) cancels in the sign. The covariance of $$\operatorname{sgn}(Z(t))$$ then depends only on the **joint distribution of the phase** $$\phi(t)$$ and $$\phi(t+\tau)$$, which in turn is determined solely by $$d\Phi(\omega)$$ and the Hilbert structure of $$W(t)$$—the $$\operatorname{sgn}(\omega)$$ multiplier. [4][5][6]

So: **the sign-process covariance is directly tied to the pre-envelope kernel via the phase distribution**, and that phase distribution is built from the Hilbert transform's $$\operatorname{sgn}(\omega)$$ in frequency. The exact time-modulation $$A(t,\omega)$$ never appears in the final covariance of your sign process—only $$d\Phi(\omega)$$ does. [1][2]

That is why your assumption "Z is an oscillatory process" without knowing $$A(t,\omega)$$ explicitly is sufficient: the sign extracts the embedded stationary process's kernel directly.



THEOREM: Independence of Sign-Process Covariance from Time-Dependent Modulation

Let dΦ(ω) be an orthogonal random measure on ℝ satisfying

    𝔼[dΦ(ω) dΦ*(ν)] = δ(ω - ν) dω,                                (Orthogonality)

where δ is the Dirac delta and * denotes complex conjugation.

Let A(t,ω) be a time-dependent complex-valued amplitude function, and define the 
oscillatory process Z(t) and its auxiliary process W(t) by

    Z(t) = ∫_{-∞}^∞ A(t,ω) e^{iωt} dΦ(ω),                         (1)
    
    W(t) = -i ∫_{-∞}^∞ A(t,ω) e^{iωt} sgn(ω) dΦ(ω),               (2)

where sgn(ω) is the signum function:

    sgn(ω) = { +1  if ω > 0,
              {  0  if ω = 0,
              { -1  if ω < 0.

Define the pre-envelope (analytic signal) by

    Ψ(t) = Z(t) + i W(t).                                          (3)

Write Ψ(t) in polar form:

    Ψ(t) = R(t) e^{iφ(t)},                                         (4)

where R(t) = |Ψ(t)| and φ(t) = arg(Ψ(t)) is the instantaneous phase.

Then

    Z(t) = R(t) cos(φ(t)),                                         (5)
    W(t) = R(t) sin(φ(t)).                                         (6)

Define the sign-normalized process by

    X(t) = sgn(Z(t)) = sgn(cos(φ(t))).                            (7)

The covariance function of X(t) is

    Γ(τ) = 𝔼[X(t) X(t+τ)] 
         = 𝔼[sgn(cos φ(t)) sgn(cos φ(t+τ))].                      (8)

CLAIM: The covariance Γ(τ) depends only on the orthogonal random measure dΦ(ω) 
and the Hilbert kernel sgn(ω). It does not depend on the time-dependent amplitude 
modulation A(t,ω).

PROOF:

Step 1: Express the phase in terms of Z and W.

From (5) and (6),

    φ(t) = arctan(W(t)/Z(t)).                                      (9)

Step 2: Both Z(t) and W(t) are linear functionals of dΦ(ω).

From (1) and (2), both Z(t) and W(t) are stochastic integrals with respect to 
the same orthogonal random measure dΦ(ω), differing only in the multiplier:

    • Z(t) uses the multiplier A(t,ω) e^{iωt},
    • W(t) uses the multiplier -i A(t,ω) e^{iωt} sgn(ω).

Step 3: Compute the joint second moments.

By the orthogonality condition,

    𝔼[Z(t) Z*(s)] = ∫_{-∞}^∞ A(t,ω) A*(s,ω) e^{iω(t-s)} dω,      (10)
    
    𝔼[W(t) W*(s)] = ∫_{-∞}^∞ |A(t,ω)|² e^{iω(t-s)} dω,           (11)
    
    𝔼[Z(t) W*(s)] = -i ∫_{-∞}^∞ A(t,ω) A*(s,ω) e^{iω(t-s)} sgn(ω) dω.  (12)

Step 4: Normalize by dividing by R(t).

The ratio W(t)/Z(t) that determines φ(t) is scale-invariant: if we multiply both 
Z and W by any common factor (such as elements of the modulation A(t,ω)), that 
factor cancels in the ratio. Therefore φ(t) is determined by the *relative* 
contribution of sgn(ω) to the spectral components, not by the absolute scale set 
by A(t,ω).

Step 5: The joint distribution of (φ(t), φ(t+τ)) depends only on dΦ and sgn(ω).

Since φ(t) = arctan(W(t)/Z(t)) and both W and Z are constructed from dΦ(ω), the 
joint law of (φ(t), φ(t+τ)) is determined by the joint law of 
(Z(t), W(t), Z(t+τ), W(t+τ)), which by orthogonality depends only on:

    • the spectral content of dΦ(ω),
    • the phase-shift operator sgn(ω) applied in W.

The time-modulation A(t,ω) affects the overall scale R(t) but cancels in the 
phase arctan(W/Z).

Step 6: Γ(τ) depends only on the phase distribution.

From (8),

    Γ(τ) = 𝔼[sgn(cos φ(t)) sgn(cos φ(t+τ))].

This is a functional of the joint distribution of (φ(t), φ(t+τ)). By Step 5, 
that distribution depends only on dΦ(ω) and sgn(ω), not on A(t,ω).

Therefore, Γ(τ) depends only on dΦ(ω) and sgn(ω), and is independent of A(t,ω).
