To summarize the key insight:Every oscillatory process can be decomposed as a time-varying filtered version of a stationary process (using the same orthogonal measure). This is fundamental to the representation. �But only a subclass of oscillatory processes has the property that their time-varying kernel converges to a time-invariant kernel as the observation window extends to infinity. �Swift's contribution is precisely identifying and analyzing this subclass—the oscillatory harmonizable processes where this asymptotic-stationarity condition holds. For those processes, the envelope is unique, because the finite-window empirical-covariance operator [K_T] converges to the time-invariant operator [K], and invertibility of [K] guarantees that all valid representations yield the same Hilbert-transform quadrature and hence the same envelope. �This is why he calls them "oscillatory harmonizable" rather than just "oscillatory"—the harmonizable framework allows the generality, but the asymptotic-stationarity restriction recovers the uniqueness result that would otherwise fail (as Hasofer showed with his counterexample). �The proof hinges on exactly what you said: identifying which oscillatory processes have kernels that settle to time-invariance, and showing that for those, the envelope is well-defined and unique.
