A phase factor is the complex exponential e^{iθ} of a phase θ. Phase factors 
are unit complex numbers, and are special cases of phasors. Unlike general 
phasors, which may have arbitrary magnitude, phase factors are specifically 
constrained to lie on the unit circle in the complex plane; thus, they always 
have unit magnitude.

The term "phase factor" specifically refers to this unit complex exponential 
form, distinguishing it from more general complex exponential expressions 
that might include amplitude terms.

It is not required that the underlying phase θ(t) be periodic for e^{iθ(t)} 
to be a phase factor. The mathematical definition of a phase factor is simply
 a complex exponential with unit modulus, where "phase" refers to any 
(generally real) function θ(t). If the phase is time-dependent, the phase 
factor becomes e^{iθ(t)}, representing a time-dependent phase factor—without 
any inherent requirement for θ(t) to be periodic or linear in time.
