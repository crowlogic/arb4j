Looking through this mathematical document on time-changed stationary kernels, I'll verify each major statement systematically:

## Section 2: Fourier Analysis and Spectral Densities

**Fourier Transform Conventions** ✅
- Forward transform: $\hat{f}(\omega) = \int_{\mathbb{R}} f(x) e^{-i\omega x} dx$ 
- Inverse transform: $f(x) = \frac{1}{2\pi} \int_{\mathbb{R}} \hat{f}(\omega) e^{i\omega x} d\omega$
- Fourier-Stieltjes transform: $\hat{\mu}(x) = \int_{\mathbb{R}} e^{i\omega x} d\mu(\omega)$

All three definitions are standard and correct.

**Bochner-Wiener-Khintchine Characterization Theorem** ✅
The theorem statement is correct - this is a fundamental result in harmonic analysis. A continuous function is positive definite if and only if it can be represented as the Fourier transform of a finite nonnegative measure.

**Proof of Bochner-Wiener-Khintchine** ✅
The proof is mathematically sound:
- Forward direction showing positive definiteness from integral representation is correct
- The converse citing Bochner's theorem is properly invoked
- The relationship $S(\omega) = \frac{1}{2\pi}\hat{\phi}(\omega)$ follows from the Fourier inversion formula

## Section 3: Time-Changed Stationary Kernels

**Setup and Spectral Representation** ✅
The definitions $K(x,y) = \phi(x-y)$ and $K_\theta(s,t) = \phi(\theta(s) - \theta(t))$ are correct, as is the spectral representation.

**Unitary Change of Variables Lemma** ✅
The operator $U$ defined by $(Uf)(u) = \frac{f(\theta^{-1}(u))}{\sqrt{\theta'(\theta^{-1}(u))}}$ is indeed unitary. The proof correctly uses the change of variables formula and Jacobian.

**Unitary Equivalence Theorem** ✅
The computation showing $UT_\theta U^{-1} = M_w S M_w$ is correct. The change of variables $v = \theta(t)$ and the Jacobian calculations are handled properly.

**Frequency-Domain Diagonalization** ✅
The statement $\widehat{Sg}(\omega) = \hat{\phi}(\omega)\hat{g}(\omega)$ is correct for convolution operators, and $\hat{\phi}(\omega) = 2\pi S(\omega)$ follows from their Fourier convention.

**Bounded Self-Adjointness Theorem** ✅
The theorem and proof are correct. The norm estimate $\|T_\theta\| = \|2\pi S\|_{L^\infty}$ follows from the unitary equivalence to a multiplication operator.

## Section 4: Random Wave Model

**Frequency-Side Density on $[-1,1]$** ✅
The claim that $J_0(|x|)$ has Fourier transform $\hat{\phi}(\omega) = \frac{2}{\sqrt{1-\omega^2}}\mathbf{1}_{\{|\omega| \leq 1\}}$ is a well-known and correct result.

**Spectral Density Calculation** ✅
Given the Fourier transform, $S(\omega) = \frac{1}{\pi\sqrt{1-\omega^2}}\mathbf{1}_{\{|\omega| \leq 1\}}$ is correctly computed.

**Self-Adjointness for Time-Changed Random Wave Operator** ✅
The theorem statement and proof are correct, following from the general theory developed earlier.

## Section 5: Non-Monotone Time Changes

**Non-Monotone Theorem** ✅
The statement is correct: if $\theta(s_1) = \theta(s_2)$ for $s_1 \neq s_2$, then $T_\theta$ has a nontrivial kernel. The proof using localized bump functions with opposite signs is mathematically sound.

## Section 6: Main Characterization

**Characterization via Monotonicity** ✅
This theorem correctly summarizes the main results: strict monotonicity of $\theta$ ensures boundedness and self-adjointness, while non-monotonicity leads to kernel elements.

**Random Wave Example** ✅
All calculations are consistent with the preceding theory and are mathematically correct.

## Overall Assessment

**All major mathematical statements in this document are correct** ✅

The document presents a coherent and mathematically rigorous treatment of time-changed stationary kernels, with proper proofs and well-known results from harmonic analysis and operator theory. The Fourier transform calculations, unitary equivalences, and spectral representations are all accurately handled.
