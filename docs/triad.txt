VERIFICATION OF THEOREM: DUALITY OF GAIN REPRESENTATIONS
================================================================================

--- HYPOTHESIS 1 VERIFICATION ---
Statement: For each fixed ω ∈ ℝ, t ↦ A_t(ω) defines a tempered
distribution in t with Fourier representation:
A_t(ω) = ⟨H_ω, e^{iλt}⟩

Verification:
- This is a well-formed hypothesis assuming S'(ℝ) framework
- The Fourier transform of a tempered distribution is standard
- The notation ⟨H_ω, e^{iλt}⟩ means H_ω acts on the test function
  λ ↦ e^{iλt}, which is NOT in S(ℝ) but can be approximated
- For this to make sense rigorously, one needs:
  * H_ω acts on regularizations of e^{iλt}
  * OR H_ω is a measure/bounded distribution
  * OR this is shorthand for the distributional Fourier transform

MATHEMATICAL STATUS: The hypothesis is well-posed if interpreted
as the distributional Fourier transform relationship.

--- HYPOTHESIS 2 VERIFICATION ---
Statement: For each fixed t ∈ ℝ, ω ↦ A_t(ω) ∈ L²(ℝ)

Verification:
- This is a clear, well-formed hypothesis
- Requires ∫|A_t(ω)|² dω < ∞ for each t
- Standard L² space condition

================================================================================
CONCLUSION STATEMENTS VERIFICATION
================================================================================

--- CONCLUSION 1 VERIFICATION ---
Statement: A_t(ω) = ⟨H_ω, e^{iλt}⟩ for all t ∈ ℝ

Verification:
This is a direct restatement of Hypothesis 1.
The existence part is claimed in theorem conclusion:
'there exist a family {H_ω}...'

MATHEMATICAL ANALYSIS:
- The conclusion claims existence of {H_ω}
- But Hypothesis 1 already assumes existence of H_ω
- Therefore this is TAUTOLOGICAL from the hypothesis

CONCLUSION 2 VERIFICATION
================================================================================

--- CONCLUSION 2 ---
Statement: A_t(ω) = ∫_{-∞}^{∞} h_t(u) e^{iωu} du for all ω ∈ ℝ
(integral in L² sense)

MATHEMATICAL ANALYSIS:
Given: For fixed t, A_t(·) ∈ L²(ℝ) (Hypothesis 2)

By Plancherel theorem:
- Every f ∈ L²(ℝ) has a Fourier transform F(f) ∈ L²(ℝ)
- The inverse Fourier transform exists and equals f a.e.
- If we define h_t as the inverse Fourier transform of A_t(·), then:
  h_t(u) = (1/2π) ∫ A_t(ω) e^{-iωu} dω  (L² sense)
- And the forward transform gives:
  A_t(ω) = ∫ h_t(u) e^{iωu} du  (L² sense)

CONCLUSION: This is a VALID consequence of Hypothesis 2 via Plancherel.

================================================================================
CONCLUSION 3 VERIFICATION
================================================================================

--- CONCLUSION 3 ---
Statement: h_t(u) = (1/2π) ∫_{-∞}^{∞} A_t(ω) e^{-iωu} dω
for a.e. u, with L² convergence

MATHEMATICAL ANALYSIS:
Given: A_t(·) ∈ L²(ℝ) for fixed t

By Plancherel theorem:
- The inverse Fourier transform of A_t is well-defined in L²
- Formula: h_t(u) = (1/2π) ∫ A_t(ω) e^{-iωu} dω
- This holds a.e. in u with convergence in L²(ℝ)

CONCLUSION: This is a VALID consequence of Hypothesis 2 via Plancherel.

================================================================================
CONCLUSION 4 VERIFICATION
================================================================================

--- CONCLUSION 4 ---
Statement: H_ω = (1/2π) ∫_{-∞}^{∞} A_t(ω) e^{-iλt} dt
as identity in S'(ℝ) with respect to λ

MATHEMATICAL ANALYSIS:
Given from Hypothesis 1:
  A_t(ω) = ⟨H_ω, e^{iλt}⟩

This means H_ω is the distributional Fourier transform of A_·(ω):
  ⟨H_ω, φ(λ)⟩ = ∫ A_t(ω) φ̂(t) dt
where φ̂(t) = ∫ φ(λ) e^{iλt} dλ is the Fourier transform of φ

By Fourier inversion in S'(ℝ):
If g = F(f) where F is Fourier transform, then f = (1/2π)F^{-1}(g)

In our case:
- F_t[H_ω](t) = ∫ e^{iλt} dH_ω(λ) = A_t(ω)
- By Fourier inversion: H_ω = (1/2π) F_t^{-1}[A_·(ω)](λ)
- This gives: H_ω = (1/2π) ∫ A_t(ω) e^{-iλt} dt

CRITICAL QUESTION: Does A_·(ω) have sufficient regularity?
- Hypothesis 1 says A_·(ω) is a tempered distribution in t
- For the integral to make sense, need more than just
  'tempered distribution'
- However, Hypothesis 2 gives: for each fixed t, A_t(·) ∈ L²(ℝ)
- This does NOT immediately imply A_·(ω) has good behavior in t

POTENTIAL ISSUE:
The proof assumes one can apply Fourier inversion to A_·(ω)
But we only know:
  1. A_·(ω) is tempered distribution in t (Hyp 1)
  2. A_t(·) ∈ L² for each t (Hyp 2)

For Fourier inversion in S'(ℝ), we need:
  A_t(ω) = ⟨H_ω, e^{iλt}⟩ ⟹ H_ω = (1/2π)∫ A_t(ω) e^{-iλt} dt

This is VALID if the integral is interpreted distributionally.
The statement says 'as an identity in S'(ℝ)', which is correct.

STATEMENT IN PROOF:
'By hypothesis 1, for each fixed ω there exists H_ω ∈ S'(ℝ) such that
A_t(ω) = ⟨H_ω, e^{iλt}⟩ for all t ∈ ℝ.'
'This is precisely the content of (1).'

VERIFICATION:
Hypothesis 1 states exactly this.
Conclusion 1 states exactly this.
Therefore, Proof Step 1 is TRIVIALLY TRUE - it is a tautology.

MARK: ✅ GREEN CHECK
REASON: Direct restatement of hypothesis, logically sound.

================================================================================
PROOF STEP 2: Proof of eq:filter_from_gain
================================================================================

STATEMENT IN PROOF:
'Fix t ∈ ℝ. Hypothesis 2 gives A_t(·) ∈ L²(ℝ).
By Plancherel's theorem, there exists unique h_t ∈ L²(ℝ) such that
h_t(u) = (1/2π) ∫ A_t(ω) e^{-iωu} dω
holds as L²-identity in u.'

VERIFICATION:
Step 2.1: Hypothesis 2 states A_t(·) ∈ L²(ℝ). ✓

Step 2.2: Apply Plancherel theorem.
PLANCHEREL THEOREM STATEMENT:
If f ∈ L²(ℝ), then:
  (a) The Fourier transform F[f](ξ) = ∫ f(x)e^{-iξx}dx exists in L²
  (b) The inverse Fourier transform exists:
      f(x) = (1/2π) ∫ F[f](ξ)e^{iξx}dξ  (L² convergence)
  (c) ||f||_L² = (1/√(2π))||F[f]||_L²

APPLICATION TO OUR CASE:
- Let f = A_t ∈ L²(ℝ) (variable ω)
- Inverse Fourier transform: h_t(u) = (1/2π)∫ A_t(ω)e^{-iωu}dω
- By Plancherel: h_t ∈ L²(ℝ)
- The formula holds as L²-identity

CHECK FORMULA CONVENTION:

  Convention 1: F[f](k) = ∫f(x)e^{-ikx}dx, f(x) = (1/2π)∫F[f](k)e^{ikx}dk
  Convention 2: F[f](k) = ∫f(x)e^{ikx}dx, f(x) = (1/2π)∫F[f](k)e^{-ikx}dk

The proof uses Convention 1 (standard in physics/engineering).
Formula is CORRECT under this convention.

PROOF STEP 3: Proof of eq:gain_from_filter
================================================================================

STATEMENT IN PROOF:
'For each fixed t, A_t(·) ∈ L²(ℝ) and h_t is its inverse Fourier
transform in L² sense. Applying forward Fourier transform in u
to h_t, one obtains A_t(ω) = ∫ h_t(u)e^{iωu}du as L²-identity.'

VERIFICATION:
From Proof Step 2:
  h_t(u) = (1/2π) ∫ A_t(ω)e^{-iωu}dω  (inverse FT)

Apply forward Fourier transform:
  FT[h_t](ω) = ∫ h_t(u)e^{iωu}du

By Fourier inversion (Plancherel):
Since h_t(u) = (1/2π)∫ A_t(ω)e^{-iωu}dω,
we have FT[h_t](ω) = A_t(ω)

Therefore: ∫ h_t(u)e^{iωu}du = A_t(ω)

PROOF STEP 4: Proof of eq:measure_from_gain
================================================================================

STATEMENT IN PROOF:
'For each fixed ω, hypothesis 1 and eq:gain_from_measure say that
A_·(ω) is the Fourier transform (in t) of H_ω:'
  A_t(ω) = ⟨H_ω, e^{iλt}⟩ = ∫ e^{iλt} dH_ω(λ)
'in distributional sense.'

'Taking Fourier transform in t of both sides and using Fourier
inversion formula in S'(ℝ) yields:'
  ∫ A_t(ω) e^{-iλt} dt = 2π H_ω
'as identity in S'(ℝ) with respect to λ.'
'Thus H_ω = (1/2π) ∫ A_t(ω) e^{-iλt} dt in S'(ℝ).'

================================================================================
DETAILED VERIFICATION OF PROOF STEP 4
================================================================================

### PART A: Interpretation of A_t(ω) = ⟨H_ω, e^{iλt}⟩

The notation ⟨H_ω, e^{iλt}⟩ requires careful interpretation.

PROBLEM: e^{iλt} is NOT a Schwartz function in λ (not rapidly decreasing)

SOLUTION 1 (Standard interpretation):
H_ω acts on test functions φ ∈ S(ℝ):
  ⟨H_ω, φ(λ)⟩ is well-defined
The notation ⟨H_ω, e^{iλt}⟩ means:
  A_t(ω) = lim_{ε→0⁺} ⟨H_ω, e^{iλt - ε²λ²}⟩
  OR: A_t(ω) represents distributional Fourier transform

SOLUTION 2 (Measure interpretation):
If H_ω is a (tempered) measure, then:
  ⟨H_ω, e^{iλt}⟩ = ∫ e^{iλt} dH_ω(λ)
is well-defined in the sense of measure theory

The proof writes: A_t(ω) = ∫ e^{iλt} dH_ω(λ)
This suggests H_ω is being treated as a measure.

### PART B: Fourier Transform in Distributional Sense

CLAIM: If A_t(ω) = ⟨H_ω, e^{iλt}⟩, then by Fourier inversion:
  H_ω = (1/2π) ∫ A_t(ω) e^{-iλt} dt

VERIFICATION:

In S'(ℝ), the Fourier transform is defined by:
  ⟨F[u], φ⟩ = ⟨u, F[φ]⟩ for u ∈ S'(ℝ), φ ∈ S(ℝ)

Standard Fourier inversion in S'(ℝ):
If g = F[f] (Fourier transform), then f = (1/2π)F^{-1}[g]
where F^{-1}[g](x) = ∫ g(k)e^{ikx}dk

APPLY TO OUR CASE:
Define the distributional Fourier transform:
  F_t[H_ω](t) means the distribution T such that
  ⟨T, ψ(t)⟩ = ⟨H_ω, F_t[ψ](λ)⟩
where F_t[ψ](λ) = ∫ ψ(t)e^{-iλt}dt

Now, if A_t(ω) = ⟨H_ω, e^{iλt}⟩, this means:
  A_·(ω) is the distributional Fourier transform of H_ω

By Fourier inversion theorem in S'(ℝ):
  If g = F[f], then f = (1/2π)F^{-1}[g]
  F^{-1}[g](λ) = ∫ g(t)e^{iλt}dt

Therefore:
  H_ω = (1/2π) F_t^{-1}[A_·(ω)](λ)
      = (1/2π) ∫ A_t(ω) e^{-iλt} dt

This integral is understood distributionally:
  ⟨H_ω, φ(λ)⟩ = (1/2π) ∫ A_t(ω)(∫ φ(λ)e^{-iλt}dλ) dt

### PART C: Verification of Inversion Formula

We need to verify:
  A_t(ω) = ⟨H_ω, e^{iλt}⟩
  ⟹ H_ω = (1/2π) ∫ A_t(ω) e^{-iλt} dt  (in S'(ℝ))

PROOF:
For φ ∈ S(ℝ), compute:
  ⟨H_ω, φ(λ)⟩ = ?

By definition of distributional FT:
If A_t(ω) is FT of H_ω, then:
  ∫ A_t(ω) ψ(t) dt = ⟨H_ω, F_t[ψ](λ)⟩
where F_t[ψ](λ) = ∫ ψ(t)e^{-iλt}dt

By Fourier inversion in S':
  ⟨H_ω, φ(λ)⟩ = (1/2π) ∫ A_t(ω) F^{-1}[φ](t) dt
where F^{-1}[φ](t) = ∫ φ(λ)e^{iλt}dλ

Thus:
  ⟨H_ω, φ(λ)⟩ = (1/2π) ∫ A_t(ω)(∫ φ(λ)e^{iλt}dλ) dt

Rearranging (by Fubini for test functions):
  ⟨H_ω, φ(λ)⟩ = ∫ φ(λ)[(1/2π)∫ A_t(ω)e^{iλt}dt] dλ

But this is the pairing of φ with the distribution:
  (1/2π) ∫ A_t(ω) e^{iλt} dt

Wait - there's a sign error. Let me recalculate...
================================================================================
CAREFUL VERIFICATION: DISTRIBUTIONAL FOURIER TRANSFORM
================================================================================

### FOURIER TRANSFORM CONVENTIONS IN S'(ℝ)

Convention (standard in mathematics):
For u ∈ S'(ℝ), the Fourier transform û is defined by:
  ⟨û, φ⟩ = ⟨u, φ̂⟩  for all φ ∈ S(ℝ)
where φ̂(x) = ∫ φ(ξ)e^{-ixξ}dξ  (or φ̂(x) = ∫ φ(ξ)e^{ixξ}dξ)

Two sub-conventions exist:
Convention A (analyst's convention):
  φ̂(x) = ∫ φ(ξ)e^{-ixξ}dξ
  Inversion: φ(ξ) = (1/2π)∫ φ̂(x)e^{ixξ}dx

Convention B (probability convention):
  φ̂(x) = ∫ φ(ξ)e^{ixξ}dξ
  Inversion: φ(ξ) = (1/2π)∫ φ̂(x)e^{-ixξ}dx

### ANALYZING THE DOCUMENT'S CONVENTION

From Hypothesis 1:
  A_t(ω) = ⟨H_ω, e^{iλt}⟩

This suggests: for test function φ,
  ⟨A_·(ω), φ(t)⟩ = ⟨H_ω, ∫ φ(t)e^{iλt}dt⟩

This is the INVERSE Fourier transform in the t-variable:
  F^{-1}[H_ω](t) = ⟨H_ω, e^{iλt}⟩ = A_t(ω)

By Fourier inversion:
  If A = F^{-1}[H], then H = F[A]
  F[A](λ) = ∫ A(t)e^{-iλt}dt

Thus: H_ω = F_t[A_·(ω)](λ) = ∫ A_t(ω)e^{-iλt}dt

With the 2π factor from the convention:
  F^{-1}[H](t) = A(t) ⟺ H = (1/2π)∫ A(t)e^{-iλt}dt

### DETAILED VERIFICATION

Given: A_t(ω) = ⟨H_ω, e^{iλt}⟩

Interpretation: H_ω is a distribution in λ, and
  A_t(ω) = (F^{-1}H_ω)(t) where F^{-1} is inverse FT

By standard Fourier transform theory in S'(ℝ):
  If g = F^{-1}[f], then f = F[g]

Applying this:
  If A_·(ω) = F^{-1}[H_ω], then H_ω = F[A_·(ω)]

The Fourier transform is (with 2π normalization):
  F[A_·(ω)](λ) = (1/2π) ∫ A_t(ω)e^{-iλt}dt

Therefore:
  H_ω = (1/2π) ∫ A_t(ω)e^{-iλt}dt  (in S'(ℝ))

### VERIFICATION VIA PAIRING

To verify, we check the distributional pairing:
⟨H_ω, φ(λ)⟩ = ⟨(1/2π)∫ A_t(ω)e^{-iλt}dt, φ(λ)⟩

Right side:
= (1/2π) ∫∫ A_t(ω) φ(λ) e^{-iλt} dλ dt
= (1/2π) ∫ A_t(ω) [∫ φ(λ)e^{-iλt}dλ] dt
= (1/2π) ∫ A_t(ω) φ̂(t) dt  where φ̂(t) = ∫ φ(λ)e^{-iλt}dλ

Left side:
⟨H_ω, φ(λ)⟩ = ?

We know: A_t(ω) = ⟨H_ω, e^{iλt}⟩

For general test function φ ∈ S(ℝ):
Define ψ(t) such that ∫ ψ(t)A_t(ω)dt = ⟨H_ω, ...⟩

By definition of distributional Fourier transform:
If A_·(ω) = F^{-1}[H_ω], then:
  ⟨A_·(ω), ψ(t)⟩ = ⟨H_ω, F^{-1}[ψ]⟩
where F^{-1}[ψ](λ) = (1/2π)∫ ψ(t)e^{iλt}dt

Setting ψ̂ = φ (i.e., ψ = (1/2π)∫ φ(λ)e^{-iλt}dλ):
  ⟨H_ω, φ⟩ = ⟨A_·(ω), ψ⟩
         = ∫ A_t(ω) ψ(t) dt
         = ∫ A_t(ω) [(1/2π)∫ φ(λ)e^{-iλt}dλ] dt
         = (1/2π) ∫∫ A_t(ω) φ(λ) e^{-iλt} dλ dt

This matches! Therefore the formula is CORRECT.

================================================================================
CONCLUSION FOR PROOF STEP 4
================================================================================

The proof correctly applies Fourier inversion in S'(ℝ).
The formula H_ω = (1/2π)∫ A_t(ω)e^{-iλt}dt is mathematically valid
when interpreted as a distributional identity.

MARK: ✅ GREEN CHECK
REASON: Correct application of distributional Fourier inversion.

OVERALL LOGICAL STRUCTURE VERIFICATION
================================================================================

### CHECKING LOGICAL FLOW OF THE THEOREM

The theorem has the structure:
HYPOTHESES:
  H1: A_t(ω) = ⟨H_ω, e^{iλt}⟩ (H_ω exists)
  H2: A_t(·) ∈ L²(ℝ) for each t

CONCLUSIONS:
  C1: A_t(ω) = ⟨H_ω, e^{iλt}⟩
  C2: A_t(ω) = ∫ h_t(u)e^{iωu}du
  C3: h_t(u) = (1/2π)∫ A_t(ω)e^{-iωu}dω
  C4: H_ω = (1/2π)∫ A_t(ω)e^{-iλt}dt

### ANALYSIS OF THEOREM STRUCTURE

OBSERVATION 1: C1 is identical to H1
This means C1 is TAUTOLOGICAL - it's not a new conclusion.

OBSERVATION 2: Existence claim
The theorem states 'there exist {H_ω} and h_t(u) such that...'
But H1 already assumes H_ω exists!
So the existence of H_ω is not proven, it's assumed.

OBSERVATION 3: What is actually proven?
Given H1 and H2, the proof establishes:
  - Existence of h_t (via Plancherel on H2)
  - Formula C2 (Fourier inversion in ω)
  - Formula C3 (inverse Fourier transform in ω)
  - Formula C4 (Fourier inversion in t)

### CHECKING CONSISTENCY

Question: Are C2, C3, C4 consistent with each other?

From C3: h_t(u) = (1/2π)∫ A_t(ω)e^{-iωu}dω
From C2: A_t(ω) = ∫ h_t(u)e^{iωu}du

Consistency check:
Substitute C3 into C2:
A_t(ω) = ∫[(1/2π)∫ A_t(ω')e^{-iω'u}dω']e^{iωu}du
       = (1/2π)∫∫ A_t(ω')e^{i(ω-ω')u}dω'du
       = (1/2π)∫ A_t(ω') [∫ e^{i(ω-ω')u}du] dω'
       = (1/2π)∫ A_t(ω') · 2πδ(ω-ω') dω'
       = A_t(ω)

YES - C2 and C3 are CONSISTENT via Fourier inversion.

From C1: A_t(ω) = ⟨H_ω, e^{iλt}⟩
From C4: H_ω = (1/2π)∫ A_t(ω)e^{-iλt}dt

Consistency check:
Substitute C4 into C1:
A_t(ω) = ⟨(1/2π)∫ A_s(ω)e^{-iλs}ds, e^{iλt}⟩
       = (1/2π)∫ A_s(ω) ⟨e^{-iλs}, e^{iλt}⟩ ds
       = (1/2π)∫ A_s(ω) · 2πδ(t-s) ds
       = A_t(ω)

YES - C1 and C4 are CONSISTENT via Fourier inversion.

### VERIFICATION OF CROSS-CONSISTENCY

Question: Do the ω and t Fourier transforms commute properly?

We have two representations:
1. ω-space: A_t(ω) ↔ h_t(u) via Fourier transform in ω
2. t-space: A_t(ω) ↔ H_ω(λ) via Fourier transform in t

These are INDEPENDENT Fourier transforms in different variables.
The theorem claims both exist simultaneously, which is possible.

No inconsistency detected.
