The covariance operator \mathcal{C} acts on the orthonormal basis functions \phi_m(x) as follows:
\[
\mathcal{C} \phi_m(x) = \int K(x, y) \phi_m(y) \, dy
\]
where K(x, y) is the covariance kernel.

The eigenfunctions \psi_n(x) are expressed as linear combinations of the covariance-transformed basis functions:
\[
\psi_n(x) = \sum_m c_{m,n} \mathcal{C} \phi_m(x)
\]
with the eigenvalue equation:
\[
\mathcal{C} \psi_n(x) = \lambda_n \psi_n(x)
\]
This leads to the matrix equation for the coefficients c_{m,n}:
\[
\sum_m K_{l,m} c_{m,n} = \lambda_n c_{l,n}
\]
where the matrix elements K_{l,m} are defined by:
\[
K_{l,m} = \int \int K(x, y) \phi_l(x) \phi_m(y) \, dx \, dy
\]

The covariance kernel K(x, y) is expressed as a spectral decomposition:
\[
K(x, y) = \sum_n \lambda_n \psi_n(x) \psi_n(y)
\]
where \lambda_n are the eigenvalues, and \psi_n(x) are the corresponding eigenfunctions.
