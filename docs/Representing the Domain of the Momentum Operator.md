# Representing the Domain of the Momentum Operator

Following the notation style used for the domain of the position operator Q in the text, which is represented as:

$D(Q) = \{\phi \in L^2(\mathbb{R}): x\phi(x) \in L^2(\mathbb{R})\}$

The domain of the momentum operator P can be symbolically represented as:

$D(P) = \{\phi \in L^2(\mathbb{R}): \phi \text{ is absolutely continuous and } \phi' \in L^2(\mathbb{R})\}$

This notation clearly indicates that:

1. Functions in the domain must be in $L^2(\mathbb{R})$
2. They must be absolutely continuous on $\mathbb{R}$
3. Their derivatives must also be square-integrable

In functional analysis literature, this space is often denoted as the Sobolev space $H^1(\mathbb{R})$ or $W^{1,2}(\mathbb{R})$, but using $D(P)$ maintains consistency with the notation used for the position operator in the quantum field theory context.
