# Floer Cohomology

Floer cohomology is an infinite-dimensional analogue of finite-dimensional Morse cohomology, introduced by Andreas Floer in 1988 as a fundamental tool for studying symplectic geometry and low-dimensional topology[^1][^2]. The theory provides invariants that arise from analyzing critical points of functionals defined on infinite-dimensional manifolds, with applications spanning from the Arnold conjecture in symplectic geometry to the topology of three- and four-dimensional manifolds[^1].

## Mathematical Construction

The construction of Floer cohomology follows a general pattern of associating to the object of interest an infinite-dimensional manifold equipped with a real-valued function[^1]. The critical points of this function generate a chain complex, while the differential is defined by counting flow lines (typically holomorphic curves or gradient flows) connecting pairs of critical points[^1][^2].

More precisely, Floer cohomology emerges as the cohomology of a chain complex formed from:

- **Chain groups**: Abelian groups spanned by critical points of the functional
- **Differential**: Defined by counting flow lines of the gradient vector field between critical points[^1]

The resulting homology is independent of auxiliary choices such as perturbations and complex structures, making it a well-defined invariant[^3].

## Principal Variants

### Symplectic Floer Cohomology

The original construction studies the free loop space of a symplectic manifold with the symplectic action functional[^1][^2]. For a symplectomorphism φ, this theory produces cohomology groups HF*(φ) satisfying:

- HF*(id) = H*(M) for the identity map
- The groups can be computed from complexes generated by fixed points when φ has nondegenerate fixed points
- Invariance under composition with exact Hamiltonian flows[^4]


### Lagrangian Floer Cohomology

This variant studies intersections of Lagrangian submanifolds within symplectic manifolds[^1][^2]. The construction involves counting holomorphic disks with boundaries on the Lagrangian submanifolds, providing tools for understanding Lagrangian intersection theory[^2].

### Instanton Floer Cohomology

For three-dimensional manifolds, this construction uses the space of SU(2)-connections with the Chern-Simons functional[^1][^2]. The critical points correspond to flat connections, while the flow lines are Yang-Mills instantons on the three-manifold[^2].

## Advanced Structures

### Product Structures

Floer cohomology admits product structures that generalize the cup product in ordinary cohomology[^4]. For symplectomorphisms φ₁, φ₂, φ₃ satisfying φ₁φ₂φ₃ = id, there exists a linear functional on HF*(φ₁) ⊗ HF*(φ₂) ⊗ HF*(φ₃)[^4]. This structure makes HF*(id) into an algebra that coincides with the quantum cohomology ring from Gromov-Witten theory[^4].

### Symplectic Cohomology

A related construction, symplectic cohomology, provides invariants for non-compact symplectic manifolds[^5][^6]. This theory uses Hamiltonian flows and holomorphic curves to define cohomology groups that capture the symplectic topology of the manifold's ends[^5].

## Applications and Significance

Floer cohomology has proven instrumental in several major mathematical developments:

- **Arnold Conjecture**: Floer's original application provided bounds on the number of fixed points of Hamiltonian symplectomorphisms[^4]
- **Three-manifold topology**: Instanton Floer homology provides invariants for distinguishing three-manifolds[^2]
- **Symplectic rigidity**: Various Floer theories establish non-displaceability results for Lagrangian submanifolds[^7]
- **Mirror symmetry**: Connections between different Floer theories illuminate aspects of mirror symmetry[^2]

The theory represents a synthesis of techniques from differential geometry, algebraic topology, and mathematical physics, with the analytic foundations resting on elliptic PDE theory and moduli spaces of holomorphic curves[^2][^6].
