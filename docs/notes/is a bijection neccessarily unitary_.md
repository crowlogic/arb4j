# is a bijection neccessarily unitary?

A **bijection** is not necessarily unitary. A bijection is simply a function that is both injective (one-to-one) and surjective (onto), meaning there is a perfect pairing between the domain and codomain[^5][^8]. In contrast, a **unitary transformation** is a special kind of bijection (specifically, a linear bijection between inner product spaces) that also preserves the inner product structure[^2][^6].

So, every unitary transformation is a bijection, but not every bijection is unitary. The property of being unitary is additional: it requires not only that the transformation is bijective and linear, but also that for all vectors \$ x \$ and \$ y \$, the inner product is preserved, i.e., \$ \langle Ux, Uy \rangle = \langle x, y \rangle \$[^2][^6][^4].

For example, a bijective function between sets (even between vector spaces) does not, in general, respect any linear or inner product structure unless it is specifically constructed to do so.

**Key distinctions:**

- **Bijection:** Any invertible function between sets, with no requirements about structure preservation[^5][^8].
- **Unitary transformation:** A bijective, linear map between inner product spaces that also preserves inner products[^2][^6].

In summary, being **unitary** is a much stronger condition than being a **bijection**.
