### Are all isomorphisms unitary?

No, **not all isomorphisms are unitary**. In mathematics, an isomorphism between vector spaces (or more generally, between algebraic structures) is simply a bijective map that preserves the structure relevant to those spaces (e.g., linearity for vector spaces). However, a **unitary map** is a much stronger requirement: it must be a linear isomorphism that also preserves the inner product of the space. Therefore, while every unitary map is an isomorphism, **not every isomorphism is unitary**—unitarity is an additional property that not all isomorphisms possess[^1][^2][^3].

### Is there a special name for a unitary isomorphism?

Yes, a **unitary isomorphism** is often called a **unitary transformation** (when between different “inner product” spaces) or a **unitary operator** (especially when the domain and codomain are the same space)[^2][^4][^5][^3]. In category theory or functional analysis, the term unitary operator is used for automorphisms of Hilbert spaces that are isomorphisms preserving inner products.

### Difference between injective and bijective functions

- **Injective (One-to-One):** A function is injective if it maps distinct elements of the domain to distinct elements in the codomain. This means no two different elements in the domain have the same image in the codomain. There may be elements in the codomain that are not images of any element in the domain[^6][^7][^8].
- **Bijective (One-to-One and Onto):** A function is bijective if it is both injective (one-to-one) and surjective (onto). That is, every element in the codomain is the image of exactly one element in the domain, forming a perfect “pairing” between domain and codomain. Bijective functions are invertible[^7][^8][^9].


#### Table: Summary of Function Types

| Property | Description |
| :-- | :-- |
| Injective | Each element of the domain maps to a unique image; |
|  | some elements in codomain may not be mapped to[^7][^9]. |
| Bijective | Each element of the domain and codomain are paired |
|  | uniquely; function is both injective and surjective[^7]. |

In sum: **Injective** means no duplicates in the image, but not necessarily full coverage. **Bijective** means both no duplicates in the image and full coverage of the codomain. A **unitary isomorphism** (unitary transformation) is a bijective map that also preserves inner products; not all isomorphisms have this property.
