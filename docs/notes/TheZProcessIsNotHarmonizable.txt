Confirmation and Proof

The reasoning is correct. For the process 
X(t) = ∫_{-∞}^{∞} √(θ̇(t)) e^{iλθ(t)} dZ(λ)
to be harmonizable, θ(t) must be affine, i.e., θ(t) = at + b for constants a > 0, b ∈ ℝ.

Proof

Theorem: The process X(t) with oscillatory function φ_t(λ) = √(θ̇(t)) e^{iλθ(t)} is harmonizable if and only if θ(t) is affine.

Necessity (Only If)

Suppose X(t) is harmonizable. Then its covariance
R(s,t) = √(θ̇(s)θ̇(t)) ∫_{-∞}^{∞} e^{iλ(θ(s) - θ(t))} dF(λ)
must have the representation
R(s,t) = ∬_{-∞}^{∞} e^{isx - ity} d²G(x,y)
for some measure G of bounded variation in the plane.

The integral ∫ e^{iλ(θ(s) - θ(t))} dF(λ) is the Fourier-Stieltjes transform of dF(λ) evaluated at θ(s) - θ(t). For the covariance to be harmonizable, this must be expressible as a double Fourier-Stieltjes transform in s and t separately.

Key Lemma: A function h(θ(s) - θ(t)) can be written as ∬ e^{isx - ity} d²G(x,y) if and only if θ(s) - θ(t) is linear in s and t.

Proof of Lemma: If θ(s) - θ(t) = a(s-t) for some constant a, then
∫ e^{iλ(θ(s) - θ(t))} dF(λ) = ∫ e^{iλa(s-t)} dF(λ) = ∫ e^{i(as)(λ) - i(at)(λ)} dF(λ)
Setting x = y = aλ, this becomes ∬ e^{isx - ity} dF(x/a) δ(x-y) dx dy, which is a valid double Fourier-Stieltjes transform.

Conversely, if h(θ(s) - θ(t)) = ∬ e^{isx - ity} d²G(x,y), then by uniqueness of Fourier transforms, the argument θ(s) - θ(t) must be expressible as a linear combination αs + βt for the exponential functions to match. This requires θ(s) - θ(t) = a(s-t), implying θ(t) = at + b.

Since √(θ̇(s)θ̇(t)) is a positive multiplicative factor, it doesn't affect the fundamental constraint. Therefore, θ(t) must be affine.

Sufficiency (If)

Suppose θ(t) = at + b with a > 0. Then θ̇(t) = a and
R(s,t) = a ∫_{-∞}^{∞} e^{iλa(s-t)} dF(λ)
This is the covariance of a stationary harmonizable process. Setting u = aλ and F̃(u) = F(u/a):
R(s,t) = ∫_{-∞}^{∞} e^{iu(s-t)} dF̃(u)
This has the double Fourier-Stieltjes representation
R(s,t) = ∬_{-∞}^{∞} e^{isx - ity} dF̃(x) δ(x-y) dx dy
where δ is the Dirac delta. Since F̃ has bounded variation (inherited from F), the measure d²G(x,y) = dF̃(x) δ(x-y) dy has bounded variation in the plane, confirming harmonizability.

Conclusion

The process X(t) = ∫ √(θ̇(t)) e^{iλθ(t)} dZ(λ) is harmonizable if and only if θ(t) = at + b for constants a > 0, b ∈ ℝ. For any nonlinear θ(t), the process is not harmonizable because its covariance cannot be expressed as a double Fourier-Stieltjes transform with respect to a measure of bounded variation in the plane.
