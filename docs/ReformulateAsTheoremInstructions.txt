write theorems with extensive detailed proofs and put it in latex document format in a code block (leaving no stone unturned). use 3rd person impersonal perspective language only. dont use the word rigorous , only a cheesy idiot would write that word rather than actually BE rigorous. do not claim to be complete because you cannot prove that it is complete you fucking ignoramus
