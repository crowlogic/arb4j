title: Answering The Riemann-Hilbert Question With Methods From The
  Theory of Inverse Scattering
---

 

 

The connection between the Riemann-Hilbert problem and the
Gelfand-Levitan-Marchenko (GLM) inverse scattering method is
foundational in linking analytical and algebraic structures within
integrable systems. Here we explore this relationship:

1.  The GLM inverse scattering method is crucial for solving integrable
    differential equations such as the Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equation,
    which is a significant nonlinear partial differential equation in
    mathematical physics. This equation is given by:
    $$\frac{\partial u}{\partial t} + 6 u \frac{\partial u}{\partial x} +
        \frac{\partial^3 u}{\partial x^3} = 0$$ This method reconstructs
    potentials from the provided scattering data, characterizing the
    evolution of solitons or wave functions.

2.  This involves finding a matrix-valued function $Y (z)$ that is
    analytic off a real line $\mathbb{R}$ and satisfies the boundary
    condition:
    $$Y_+ (z) = Y_- (z) \cdot v (z) \forall z \in \mathbb{R}$$ where
    $v (z)$ represents the jump matrix derived from scattering data.

3.  The GLM method's kernel $K (x, t)$ related to the system's
    potential, can be derived from the scattering data $S (k)$. The
    integral equation in GLM form is given by:
    $$K (x, y) + F (x + y) + \int_x^{\infty} K (x, z) F (z + y)  \hspace{0.17em}
        dz = 0 \forall x, y \geq 0$$ where $F$ is related to the inverse
    Fourier transform of $S (k)$.

4.  Solving the analytic Riemann-Hilbert problem translates into solving
    algebraic GLM integral equations, providing a framework for
    understanding how changes in the contour or boundary conditions
    impact the solutions.

5.  The solution to the Riemann-Hilbert problem facilitates the explicit
    expression of solitons, which are solutions to the KdV and other
    nonlinear wave equations. The soliton solutions $q (x, t)$ are often
    expressed as: $$q (x, t) = - 2 \frac{d^2}{dx^2} \log \det (I + K)$$

6.  Beyond understanding soliton dynamics, solving the Riemann-Hilbert
    problem has broader implications for the stability analysis of
    solitons and the asymptotic behavior of solutions in integrable
    systems.
