  \POne-dimensional spectral problems are smoothly deformable like
  C\<infty\>-functions, while multi-dimensional problems are rigid like
  analytic functions (at least in Euclidean spaces).\Q This statement
  \ provided touches on a fundamental distinction in the behavior of spectral
  problems depending on the dimensionality of the space in which they are
  considered. This distinction is grounded in the mathematical properties of
  functions and the nature of differential equations governing the spectral
  problems.

  <section*|One-Dimensional Spectral Problems>

  In one-dimensional spaces, spectral problems involve solving differential
  equations with boundary conditions on a line or interval. The solutions to
  these problems, which determine the spectrum (the set of eigenvalues) of
  the associated differential operator, are highly sensitive to smooth
  deformations of the operator or the boundary conditions. This sensitivity
  means that small, smooth changes in the problem's parameters can lead to
  smooth changes in the spectrum. This behavior is analogous to that of
  <math|C<rsup|\<infty\>>>-functions, which are infinitely differentiable and
  can thus be smoothly modified.

  <section*|Multi-Dimensional Spectral Problems>

  In contrast, for multi-dimensional spectral problems, which involve partial
  differential equations on domains in Euclidean spaces of dimension two or
  higher, the situation is markedly different. These problems exhibit a form
  of rigidity, meaning that the spectrum of the differential operator is more
  stable under small deformations. This stability is akin to the behavior of
  analytic functions, which are defined not just by their infinite
  differentiability but also by the condition that their Taylor series
  converge to the function in some neighborhood of every point in their
  domain. Analytic functions are rigid in the sense that their values over an
  entire domain are determined by their values (and the values of their
  derivatives) in an arbitrarily small neighborhood.

  <section*|Mathematical Foundations>

  The difference in behavior between one-dimensional and multi-dimensional
  spectral problems is fundamentally linked to the mathematical structure of
  the differential equations involved. In one dimension, the solutions to
  differential equations can often be expressed in terms of smooth functions
  whose properties allow for a great deal of flexibility. In higher
  dimensions, however, the solutions are subject to more complex conditions
  that stem from the interplay between different directions in space. This
  complexity leads to a form of rigidity, as changes in one part of the
  domain can have far-reaching implications due to the interconnectedness of
  the space.

  <section*|Conclusion>

  Thus, the assertion that one-dimensional spectral problems are smoothly
  deformable like <math|C<rsup|\<infty\>>>-functions, while multi-dimensional
  problems are rigid like analytic functions, is an insightful observation on
  the intrinsic nature of these mathematical problems. It highlights the
  profound impact that the dimensionality of space has on the behavior of
  spectral problems and the solutions to the differential equations that
  define them.
