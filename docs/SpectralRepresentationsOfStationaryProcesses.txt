SPECTRAL RECOVERY FROM SAMPLE PATHS: THEOREMS AND PROOFS
Date: 2025-11-16

DEFINITIONS

Let X(t) be a real-valued, zero-mean, stationary Gaussian sample path indexed by t in ℝ.

The complex orthogonal random measure is denoted:
  Φ(λ) = U(λ) - i V(λ)
where U(λ) and V(λ) are orthogonal random measures indexed by λ ≥ 0.

The sample path representation of X(t) is:
  X(t) = ∫₀^∞ cos(λ t) dU(λ) + sin(λ t) dV(λ)

The orthogonal random measures U and V form a factorization of Φ.

The orthogonal random measures U and V are absolutely continuous with respect to Lebesgue measure. The Radon–Nikodym density of U is denoted u(λ) such that dU(λ) = u(λ) dλ. The Radon–Nikodym density of V is denoted v(λ) such that dV(λ) = v(λ) dλ.

The Radon–Nikodym density of the complex orthogonal random measure Φ is defined as:
  φ(λ) = u(λ) - i v(λ)

The quadrature component is:
  Ĥ(t) = ∫₀^∞ sin(λ t) dU(λ) - cos(λ t) dV(λ)

The pre-envelope process is:
  Z(t) = X(t) + i Ĥ(t)

THEOREM 1: SAMPLE PATH REPRESENTATION IN TERMS OF THE COMPLEX ORTHOGONAL RANDOM MEASURE

The pre-envelope process Z(t) admits the representation:
  Z(t) = ∫₀^∞ e^{i λ t} dΦ(λ)
       = ∫₀^∞ e^{i λ t} φ(λ) dλ

PROOF:

Start with the pre-envelope process Z(t) = X(t) + i Ĥ(t).

Substitute the sample path representation of X(t):
  Z(t) = ∫₀^∞ cos(λ t) dU(λ) + sin(λ t) dV(λ)
       + i ∫₀^∞ sin(λ t) dU(λ) - cos(λ t) dV(λ)

Collect the terms by measure:
  Z(t) = ∫₀^∞ [cos(λ t) + i sin(λ t)] dU(λ)
       + ∫₀^∞ [sin(λ t) - i cos(λ t)] dV(λ)

Apply Euler's formula to the first integral:
  cos(λ t) + i sin(λ t) = e^{i λ t}

Apply the identity to the second integral. Recognize that:
  sin(λ t) - i cos(λ t) = -i [cos(λ t) + i sin(λ t)] = -i e^{i λ t}

Therefore:
  Z(t) = ∫₀^∞ e^{i λ t} dU(λ) - i ∫₀^∞ e^{i λ t} dV(λ)
       = ∫₀^∞ e^{i λ t} [dU(λ) - i dV(λ)]
       = ∫₀^∞ e^{i λ t} dΦ(λ)

Since U and V are absolutely continuous, dΦ(λ) = φ(λ) dλ where φ(λ) = u(λ) - i v(λ).

Thus Z(t) = ∫₀^∞ e^{i λ t} φ(λ) dλ.  QED.

THEOREM 2: INVERSION OF THE RADON–NIKODYM DENSITY φ(λ) FROM THE PRE-ENVELOPE PROCESS

Let Z(t) be the pre-envelope process derived from X(t). The Radon–Nikodym density φ(λ) of the complex orthogonal random measure Φ is recovered by:
  φ(λ) = (1 / 2π) ∫_{-∞}^{∞} Z(t) e^{-i λ t} dt

PROOF:

The representation from Theorem 1 is:
  Z(t) = ∫₀^∞ e^{i λ t} φ(λ) dλ

Apply the inverse Fourier transform. Multiply both sides by e^{-i ω t} and integrate over t from negative infinity to positive infinity:

  ∫_{-∞}^{∞} Z(t) e^{-i ω t} dt = ∫_{-∞}^{∞} ∫₀^∞ e^{i λ t} φ(λ) dλ  e^{-i ω t} dt

Interchange the order of integration (justified by Fubini's theorem under suitable integrability conditions):

  ∫_{-∞}^{∞} Z(t) e^{-i ω t} dt = ∫₀^∞ φ(λ) [∫_{-∞}^{∞} e^{i (λ - ω) t} dt] dλ

The inner integral is the Dirac delta function:
  ∫_{-∞}^{∞} e^{i (λ - ω) t} dt = 2π δ(λ - ω)

Therefore:
  ∫_{-∞}^{∞} Z(t) e^{-i ω t} dt = ∫₀^∞ φ(λ) 2π δ(λ - ω) dλ = 2π φ(ω)

Solve for φ(ω):
  φ(ω) = (1 / 2π) ∫_{-∞}^{∞} Z(t) e^{-i ω t} dt

The result holds for ω ≥ 0 because the delta function δ(λ - ω) vanishes when λ ∈ [0, ∞) and ω < 0.  QED.

THEOREM 3: INVERSION OF THE RADON–NIKODYM DENSITY u(λ) VIA COSINE TRANSFORM

The Radon–Nikodym density u(λ) of the orthogonal random measure U is given by:
  u(λ) = (2 / π) ∫₀^∞ X(t) cos(λ t) dt

PROOF:

Start with the sample path representation:
  X(t) = ∫₀^∞ cos(λ t) dU(λ) + sin(λ t) dV(λ)

Multiply both sides by cos(ω t) and integrate over t from 0 to infinity:
  ∫₀^∞ X(t) cos(ω t) dt = ∫₀^∞ [∫₀^∞ cos(λ t) dU(λ) + sin(λ t) dV(λ)] cos(ω t) dt

Interchange the order of integration:
  ∫₀^∞ X(t) cos(ω t) dt = ∫₀^∞ dU(λ) ∫₀^∞ cos(λ t) cos(ω t) dt
                         + ∫₀^∞ dV(λ) ∫₀^∞ sin(λ t) cos(ω t) dt

Apply the orthogonality relations for trigonometric functions:
  ∫₀^∞ cos(λ t) cos(ω t) dt = (π / 2) δ(λ - ω)
  ∫₀^∞ sin(λ t) cos(ω t) dt = 0

Therefore:
  ∫₀^∞ X(t) cos(ω t) dt = (π / 2) ∫ dU(λ) δ(λ - ω) = (π / 2) u(ω)

Solve for u(ω):
  u(ω) = (2 / π) ∫₀^∞ X(t) cos(ω t) dt  QED.

THEOREM 4: THE ORTHOGONAL RANDOM MEASURE U(λ) FROM ITS RADON–NIKODYM DENSITY u(λ)

Given the Radon–Nikodym density u(λ) from Theorem 3, the orthogonal random measure U(λ) is obtained by integration:
  U(λ) = ∫₀^λ u(ω) dω = (2 / π) ∫₀^∞ X(t) [sin(λ t) / t] dt

PROOF:

By definition of measure and Radon–Nikodym density:
  U(λ) = ∫₀^λ dU(ω) = ∫₀^λ u(ω) dω

Substitute the formula for u(ω) from Theorem 3:
  U(λ) = ∫₀^λ [(2 / π) ∫₀^∞ X(t) cos(ω t) dt] dω

Interchange the order of integration:
  U(λ) = (2 / π) ∫₀^∞ X(t) [∫₀^λ cos(ω t) dω] dt

Evaluate the inner integral with respect to ω:
  ∫₀^λ cos(ω t) dω = [sin(ω t) / t]_{ω=0}^{ω=λ} = sin(λ t) / t

(The lower bound at ω = 0 contributes zero.)

Substitute back:
  U(λ) = (2 / π) ∫₀^∞ X(t) [sin(λ t) / t] dt  QED.

THEOREM 5: INVERSION OF THE RADON–NIKODYM DENSITY v(λ) VIA SINE TRANSFORM

The Radon–Nikodym density v(λ) of the orthogonal random measure V is given by:
  v(λ) = (2 / π) ∫₀^∞ X(t) sin(λ t) dt

PROOF:

Start with the sample path representation:
  X(t) = ∫₀^∞ cos(λ t) dU(λ) + sin(λ t) dV(λ)

Multiply both sides by sin(ω t) and integrate over t from 0 to infinity:
  ∫₀^∞ X(t) sin(ω t) dt = ∫₀^∞ dU(λ) ∫₀^∞ cos(λ t) sin(ω t) dt
                         + ∫₀^∞ dV(λ) ∫₀^∞ sin(λ t) sin(ω t) dt

Apply the orthogonality relations:
  ∫₀^∞ cos(λ t) sin(ω t) dt = 0
  ∫₀^∞ sin(λ t) sin(ω t) dt = (π / 2) δ(λ - ω)

Therefore:
  ∫₀^∞ X(t) sin(ω t) dt = (π / 2) ∫ dV(λ) δ(λ - ω) = (π / 2) v(ω)

Solve for v(ω):
  v(ω) = (2 / π) ∫₀^∞ X(t) sin(ω t) dt  QED.

---

THEOREM 6: THE ORTHOGONAL RANDOM MEASURE V(λ) FROM ITS RADON–NIKODYM DENSITY v(λ)

Given the Radon–Nikodym density v(λ) from Theorem 5, the orthogonal random measure V(λ) is obtained by integration:
  V(λ) = ∫₀^λ v(ω) dω = (2 / π) ∫₀^∞ X(t) [1 - cos(λ t)] / t dt

PROOF:

By definition:
  V(λ) = ∫₀^λ dV(ω) = ∫₀^λ v(ω) dω

Substitute the formula for v(ω) from Theorem 5:
  V(λ) = ∫₀^λ [(2 / π) ∫₀^∞ X(t) sin(ω t) dt] dω

Interchange the order of integration:
  V(λ) = (2 / π) ∫₀^∞ X(t) [∫₀^λ sin(ω t) dω] dt

Evaluate the inner integral with respect to ω:
  ∫₀^λ sin(ω t) dω = [-cos(ω t) / t]_{ω=0}^{ω=λ} = [-cos(λ t) / t + 1 / t]
                   = [1 - cos(λ t)] / t

Substitute back:
  V(λ) = (2 / π) ∫₀^∞ X(t) [1 - cos(λ t)] / t dt  QED.

THEOREM 7: RECOVERY OF THE COMPLEX ORTHOGONAL RANDOM MEASURE Φ(λ)

The complex orthogonal random measure Φ(λ) = U(λ) - i V(λ) is given by:
  Φ(λ) = U(λ) - i V(λ)
        = (2 / π) ∫₀^∞ X(t) [sin(λ t) / t] dt - i (2 / π) ∫₀^∞ X(t) [1 - cos(λ t)] / t dt

The Radon–Nikodym density φ(λ) of Φ satisfies:
  φ(λ) = u(λ) - i v(λ)
        = (2 / π) ∫₀^∞ X(t) [cos(λ t) - i sin(λ t)] dt
        = (2 / π) ∫₀^∞ X(t) e^{-i λ t} dt

PROOF:

From Theorem 4, U(λ) = (2 / π) ∫₀^∞ X(t) [sin(λ t) / t] dt.

From Theorem 6, V(λ) = (2 / π) ∫₀^∞ X(t) [1 - cos(λ t)] / t dt.

By definition, Φ(λ) = U(λ) - i V(λ).

Therefore:
  Φ(λ) = (2 / π) ∫₀^∞ X(t) {[sin(λ t) / t] - i [1 - cos(λ t)] / t} dt

For the Radon–Nikodym density, from Theorems 3 and 5:
  φ(λ) = u(λ) - i v(λ)
        = (2 / π) ∫₀^∞ X(t) [cos(λ t) - i sin(λ t)] dt
        = (2 / π) ∫₀^∞ X(t) e^{-i λ t} dt

where the last equality follows from Euler's formula.

The relationship between Radon–Nikodym density and measure is:
  dΦ(λ) = φ(λ) dλ
  Φ(λ) = ∫₀^λ φ(ω) dω

QED.
