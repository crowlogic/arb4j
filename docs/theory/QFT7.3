1  The Wightman Axioms 

A. S. Wightman [?] proposed his axioms for quantum field theory over 20 years ago. Since then his axioms have been studied intensively by many investigators. It is generally agreed by a majority of workers in this area that the Wightman axioms are a reasonable set of postulates for a quantum field theory. It can be shown (see Sections 7.4, 7.5) that there exist mathematical models for noninteracting quantum systems that satisfy Wightman's axioms. Unfortunately, mathematical models for quantum systems with nontrivial interactions satisfying the axioms have not yet been exhibited. However, as we shall see in Section 7.5, important progress has been made.
Quantum field theory describes relativistic quantum systems with an infinite number of degrees of freedom. The geometry of a relativistic system is given by Minkowski space M^4 where M^4=ℝ^4 equipped with the indefinite inner product
x⋅y=x_0*y_0-x_1*y_1-x_2*y_2-x_3*y_3  (1)
where x=(x_0,x_1,x_2,x_3),y=(y_0,y_1,y_2,y_3). We frequently write (1) in the more concise notation x⋅y=x_0*y_0-x⋅y where x=(x_1,x_2,x_3),y=(y_1,y_2,y_3). The x_0 component of a vector x∈M^4 represents the "time" coordinate c*t, where c is the speed of light and the vector x∈ℝ^3 represents the "space" coordinates. For this reason M^4 is frequently called space-time.
The forward cone V_+ is the set
V_+={x∈M^4:x_0>0,x⋅x=x_0^2-x⋅x>0}  (2)
The boundary ∂*V_+ of V_+ is the set
∂*V_+={x∈M^4:x_0≥0,x⋅x=x_0^2-x⋅x=0}  (3)
If a system is initially at the origin 0∈M^4 and travels forward in time at the speed of light, then its coordinate x at a later time t will satisfy x⋅x=c^2*t^2=x_0^2. Hence x∈∂*V_+. If a system is initially at the origin and travels forward in time at less than the speed of light, then its coordinate x at a later time t satisfies x⋅x<c^2*t^2=x_0^2 so x∈V_+. Since any physical system cannot have a speed faster than that of light, any system, initially at 0, moving forward in time must have coordinate x∈V¯_+, the closure of V_+. Analogously, systems initially at 0 moving backward in time must have coordinate x∈V¯_- where V_- is the backward cone
V_-={x∈M^4:x_0<0,x⋅x=x_0^2-x⋅x>0}  (4)
In this way V_+ represents the "future" and V_- represents the "past." Vectors in V¯_+∪V¯_- are timelike and vectors in the complement M^4-(V¯_+∪V¯_-) (i.e., x⋅x<0 ) are called spacelike.
Two vectors x,y∈M^4 are timelike separated if (x-y)⋅(x-y)≥0. Thus x,y are timelike separated if and only if x-y∈V¯_+∪V¯_-. Physically, timelike separated systems can interact since a signal traveling at a speed not greater than c can be transmitted from one to the other. Analogously, x,y∈M^4 are spacelike separated if (x-y)⋅(x-y)<0. Spacelike separated systems cannot interact since no physical communication is possible between them.
The symmetries of space-time are given by the Lorentz group ℒ which consists of all linear transformations from M^4 onto M^4 which preserve the Minkowski inner product. That is, a linear transformation Λ of M^4 onto M^4 is in ℒ if and only if (Λ*x)⋅(Λ*y)=x⋅y for every x,y∈M^4. We would like to extend ℒ to include space-time translations x↦x+a,a∈M^4. This larger group is called the Poincaré group P or the inhomogeneous Lorentz group. Precisely, P is the set of all pairs (a,Λ),a∈M^4,Λ∈ℒ, where (a,Λ):M^4→M^4 is the transformation defined by (a,Λ)*x=Λ*x+a, for every x∈M^4. Since
(a_1,Λ_1)(a_2,Λ_2)*x =(a_1,Λ_1)*(Λ_2*x+a_2) (5)
                     =Λ_1*Λ_2*x+Λ_1*a_2+a_1=(a_1+Λ_1*a_2,Λ_1*Λ_2)*x (6)

the multiplication law for P is
(a_1,Λ_1)(a_2,Λ_2)=(a_1+Λ_1*a_2,Λ_1*Λ_2)  (7)
It is straightforward to show that P is indeed a group and that (a,Λ)^(-1)*x=Λ^(-1)*(x-a).
We are now ready to present Wightman's axioms. We first give some heuristic background and then state the axioms precisely. Our object is to give a mathematical description of a quantum phenomenon occurring in space-time M^4. We think of this phenomenon as a physical "field" in M^4. Ideally, each point x∈M^4 would give an observable Θ(x) representing the field at x. Such an idealization is impossible however, due to the imprecision of measurements and possible singularities of the physical field. [In fact, it can be proved [?] that such a Θ(x) with mild physical properties is impossible.] The best we can do is find the average field over small regions of M^4. This may be accomplished by "smearing" the field with a test function ϕ∈δ(ℝ^4). We have already encountered such situations in our study of random fields in Chapter 6. Thus for every ϕ∈𝒮(ℝ^4) we assume there exists an operator Θ(ϕ) on a fixed Hilbert space ℋ. If ϕ is real valued, then Θ(ϕ) is assumed to be symmetric. [Physically one would want Θ(ϕ) to be self-adjoint, but we are trying to be very general here. Presumably, Θ(ϕ) would have a self-adjoint extension if its domain is properly adjusted.] It is reasonable that ϕ↦Θ(ϕ) is linear and weakly continuous. We say that ϕ,ψ∈𝒮(ℝ^4) are spacelike separated if their supports are spacelike separated; that is, (x-y)⋅(x-y)<0 for every x∈suppϕ and y∈suppψ. If ϕ,ψ are spacelike separated, then they correspond to regions of space-time which cannot interact. We then assume that Θ(ϕ) and Θ(ψ) can be simultaneously measured and hence commute. This is called locality or microscopic causality.
If we make a symmetry transformation in M^4, then there should be a corresponding symmetry transformation of the states in ℋ. We therefore assume that there exists a unitary representation U of the Poincaré group P in H. For ϕ∈𝒮(ℝ^4),(a,Λ)∈P,ϕ∘(a,Λ)^(-1) represents the test function ϕ after transformation by the symmetry (a,Λ). The field operator Θ(ϕ) is transformed into the field operator Θ*[ϕ∘(a,Λ)^(-1)]. By the physical interpretation of U(a,Λ) we should have
U(a,Λ)*Θ(ϕ)*U(a,Λ)^∗=Θ*[ϕ∘(a,Λ)^(-1)]  (8)
Equation (8) is called Lorentz or relativistic covariance. Physically there should be a distinguished unit vector h∈ℋ which represents the unique vacuum state; that is, the state in which no particles are present. The state represented by h should be invariant under all symmetry transformations. We thus assume that U(a,Λ)*h=h for every (a,Λ)∈P and that h is unique (up to a multiple of modulus one).
There is one more condition to be considered. For a_0∈ℝ, the map a_0↦U((a_0,0,0,0),I) is a strongly continuous one-parameter unitary group. Hence by Stone's theorem [?], there exists a self-adjoint operator P_0 on H such that U((a_0,0,0,0),I)=e^(i*a_0*P_0). In a similar way, we have the self-adjoint operators P_1,P_2,P_3 corresponding to a_1,a_2,a_3∈ℝ. Hence, for a=(a_0,a_1,a_2,a_3)∈ℝ^4 we have
U(a,I)=e^(i*a⋅P)=e^(i*[a_0*P_0-a⋅P]),  (9)
where P=(P_0,P_1,P_2,P_3) and P=(P_1,P_2,P_3). We interpret P as the energy-momentum operator (P_0 corresponds to energy and P corresponds to momentum). Again by Stone's theorem there exists a spectral measure E(⋅) on ℝ^4 such that
U(a,I)=int_(ℝ^4)e^(i*a⋅x)*E*(d*x).  (10)
Our last condition is that suppE*(d*x)⊆V¯_+. This is called the spectrum condition and amounts to the fact that the total energy of the system is nonnegative in a certain sense.
We now give a concise formulation of the Wightman axioms for a neutral scalar field.
1.(Hilbert Space) There exists a Hilbert space H with a distinguished unit vector h∈H called the vacuum.
2.(Fields and Temperedness) There exists a dense subspace D⊆H and for every ϕ∈δ(ℝ^4) an operator Θ(ϕ) with domain D such that:
a.for every f,g∈D,ϕ↦⟨Θ(ϕ)*f,g⟩ is a tempered distribution;
b.if ϕ is real valued, then Θ(ϕ) is symmetric, that is, ⟨Θ(ϕ)*f,g⟩=⟨f,Θ(ϕ)*g⟩ for every f,g∈D;
c.Θ(ϕ) leaves D invariant, that is, f∈D implies that Θ(ϕ)*f∈D;
d.h∈D and D=span{Θ(ϕ_1)*…*Θ(ϕ_n)*h:ϕ_1,…,ϕ_n∈δ(ℝ^n)}.
3.(Covariance) There exists a unitary representation of the Poincaré group P,(a,Λ)↦U(a,Λ), such that:
a.U(a,Λ) leaves D invariant;
b.U(a,Λ)*h=h for every (a,Λ)∈P;
c.U(a,Λ)*Θ(ϕ)*U(a,Λ)^∗*f=Θ*[ϕ∘(a,Λ)^(-1)]*f for all f∈D.
4.(Spectrum Condition) The joint spectrum of the infinitesimal generators of U(a,I) lies in V¯_+.
5.(Locality) If ϕ and ψ are spacelike separated, then [Θ(ϕ)*Θ(ψ)-Θ(ψ)*Θ(ϕ)]*f=0 for all f∈D.
6.(Uniqueness of Vacuum) The only vectors in ℋ left invariant by all the U(a,I),a∈ℝ^4, are multiples of h.
We call a four-tuple (Θ,D,U,h) satisfying conditions (1)-(6) above a Wightman quantum field. It can be shown that 3(a) above follows from 2(d), 3(b), and 3(c). There is an equivalent formulation of the Wightman axioms which is physically less transparent but technically simpler. This formulation is phrased entirely in terms of tempered distributions and hence avoids the use of the cumbersome unbounded operators. For a fixed integer n≥1, define
W_n(ϕ_1,…,ϕ_n)=⟨Θ(ϕ_1)*⋯*Θ(ϕ_n)*h,h⟩.  (11)
For notational convenience we define W_0:C→C by W_0(λ)=λ. The W_n's are clearly multilinear in ϕ_1,…,ϕ_n and by 2(a) separately continuous. It follows from the nuclear theorem (Theorem 5.7) that there exist tempered distributions W_n∈𝒮'(ℝ^(4*n)) such that
W_n(ϕ_1,…,ϕ_n)=W_n*(ϕ_1⊗⋯⊗ϕ_n).  (12)
The W_n's are called vacuum expectation values and the W_n's are called Wightman distributions. The properties of the Wightman distributions are summarized in the following theorem.
Theorem 1. The Wightman distributions W_n associated with a system obeying the Wightman axioms satisfy:
(W1).(Positive Definiteness) For given ϕ_0∈C, ϕ_1∈δ(ℝ^4),…,ϕ_n∈δ(ℝ^(4*n)),
sum_(i,j=0)^nW_(i+j)*(ϕ_j^∗⊗ϕ_i)≥0,  (13)
where ϕ^∗ is given by (5.16).
(W2).(Reality) For every ϕ∈δ(ℝ^(4*n)),W_n(ϕ^∗)=W¯_n(ϕ).
(W3).(Covariance) For (a,Λ)∈P and ϕ∈δ(ℝ^(4*n)) define
ϕ∘(a,Λ)^(-1)(x_1,…,x_n)=ϕ*((a,Λ)^(-1)*x_1,…,(a,Λ)^(-1)*x_n),  (14)
x_1,…,x_n∈ℝ^4. Then W_n*[ϕ∘(a,Λ)^(-1)]=W_n(ϕ).
(W4).(Spectrum Condition) For any integer n>0 there is a tempered distribution M_n∈δ'(ℝ^(4*n-4)) satisfying:
(a).for every ϕ∈δ(ℝ^(4*n)),W_n(ϕ)=M_n(ϕ^), where
ϕ^*(y_1,…,y_(n-1))=ϕ*(0,y_1,y_2+y_1,…,y_(n-1)+y_(n-2)+⋯+y_1);  (15)
(b).suppF*M_n⊆{(x_1,…,x_(n-1)):x_i∈V¯_+,i=1,…,n-1}.
(W5).(Locality) If ϕ_j,ϕ_(j+1)∈δ(ℝ^4) are spacelike separated, then
 W_n*(ϕ_1⊗⋯⊗ϕ_j⊗ϕ_(j+1)⊗⋯⊗ϕ_n) (16)
 =W_n*(ϕ_1⊗⋯⊗ϕ_(j+1)⊗ϕ_j⊗⋯⊗ϕ_n). (17)

(W6).(Cluster Property) If a∈M^4 is spacelike and T_(j,a):δ(ℝ^(4*n))→δ(ℝ^(4*n)) denotes the translation operator
T_(j,a)*ϕ*(x_1,…,x_n)=ϕ*(x_1,…,x_j,x_(j+1)-a,…,x_n-a)  (18)
for 0≤j≤n, then lim_(λ→∞) T_(j,λ*a)*W_n=W_j⊗W_(n-j).
Proof. Since linear combinations of test functions of the form ϕ_1⊗⋯⊗ϕ_n are dense in δ(ℝ^(4*n)), the verification of the conditions for such test functions is sufficient.
(W2) For ϕ∈𝒮(ℝ^4) it follows from 2(b) that ⟨Θ(ϕ¯)*h,h⟩=⟨h,Θ(ϕ)*h⟩. Indeed, let ϕ=ϕ_1+i*ϕ_2 where ϕ_1 and ϕ_2 are the real and imaginary parts of ϕ, respectively. Then
⟨Θ(ϕ¯)*h,h⟩ =⟨Θ*(ϕ_1-i*ϕ_2)*h,h⟩=⟨[Θ(ϕ_1)-i*Θ(ϕ_2)]*h,h⟩ (19)
            =⟨h,[Θ(ϕ_1)+i*Θ(ϕ_2)]*h⟩=⟨h,Θ(ϕ)*h⟩. (20)

Now suppose that ϕ∈𝒮(ℝ^(4*n)) and ϕ=ϕ_1⊗⋯⊗ϕ_n,ϕ_i∈𝒮(ℝ^4),i=1,…,n. Then
W_n(ϕ^∗) =W_n*(ϕ¯_n⊗⋯⊗ϕ¯_1)=W_n(ϕ¯_n,⋯,ϕ¯_1) (21)
         =⟨Θ(ϕ¯_n)*⋯*Θ(ϕ¯_1)*h,h⟩=⟨h,Θ(ϕ_1)*⋯*Θ(ϕ_n)*h⟩ (22)
         =W¯_n(ϕ_1,…,ϕ_n)=W¯_n*(ϕ_1⊗⋯⊗ϕ_n)=W¯_n(ϕ) (23)

(W3) If ϕ∈𝒮(ℝ^(4*n)) and ϕ=ϕ_1⊗⋯⊗ϕ_n,ϕ_i∈𝒮(ℝ^4), then by 3(b) and 3(c) we have
W_n*[ϕ∘(a,Λ)^(-1)] =W_n*[ϕ_1∘(a,Λ)^(-1)⊗⋯⊗ϕ_n∘(a,Λ)^(-1)] (24)
                   =W_n[ϕ_1∘(a,Λ)^(-1),…,ϕ_n∘(a,Λ)^(-1)] (25)
                   =⟨Θ*[ϕ_1∘(a,Λ)^(-1)]*⋯*Θ*[ϕ_n∘(a,Λ)^(-1)]*h,h⟩ (26)
                   =⟨U(a,Λ)*Θ(ϕ_1)*⋯*Θ(ϕ_n)*U(a,Λ)^∗*h,h⟩ (27)
                   =⟨Θ(ϕ_1)*⋯*Θ(ϕ_n)*h,h⟩=W_n(ϕ_1,…,ϕ_n)=W_n(ϕ) (28)

(W5) If ϕ_j,ϕ_(j+1)∈S(ℝ^4) are spacelike separated, then applying 2(c) and (5) we have
W_n (ϕ_1⊗⋯⊗ϕ_n)=⟨Θ(ϕ_1)*⋯*Θ(ϕ_n)*h,h⟩ (29)
    =⟨Θ(ϕ_j)*Θ(ϕ_(j+1))*⋯*Θ(ϕ_n)*h,Θ(ϕ¯_(j-1))*⋯*Θ(ϕ¯_1)*h⟩ (30)
    =⟨Θ(ϕ_(j+1))*Θ(ϕ_j)*⋯*Θ(ϕ_n)*h,Θ(ϕ¯_(j-1))*⋯*Θ(ϕ¯_1)*h⟩ (31)
    =W_n(ϕ_1,…,ϕ_(j+1),ϕ_j,…,ϕ_n)=W_n*(ϕ_1⊗⋯⊗ϕ_(j+1)⊗ϕ_j⊗⋯⊗ϕ_n). (32)

(W1) For ϕ_1,…,ϕ_n∈𝒮(ℝ^4) define
F_n(ϕ_1,…,ϕ_n)=Θ(ϕ_1)*⋯*Θ(ϕ_n)*h  (33)
Then F_n is a multilinear vector-valued function which is continuous in each argument. By a slight generalization of the nuclear theorem, there exists a vector-valued tempered distribution Θ_n on δ(ℝ^(4*n)) such that
F_n(ϕ_1,…,ϕ_n)=Θ_n*(ϕ_1⊗⋯⊗ϕ_n)  (34)
Moreover, Θ_n satisfies
⟨Θ_n(ϕ),Θ_m(ψ)⟩=W_(n+m)*(ψ^∗⊗ϕ)  (35)
Indeed, if ϕ=ϕ_1⊗⋯⊗ϕ_n and ψ=ψ_1⊗⋯⊗ψ_n, then we have
⟨Θ_n(ϕ),Θ_m(ψ)⟩ =⟨Θ(ϕ_1)*⋯*Θ(ϕ_n)*h,Θ(ψ_1)*⋯*Θ(ψ_m)*h⟩ (36)
                =⟨Θ(ψ¯_m)*⋯*Θ(ψ¯_1)*Θ(ϕ_1)*⋯*Θ(ϕ_n)*h,h⟩ (37)
                =W_(n+m)(ψ¯_m,⋯,ψ¯_1,ϕ_1,…,ϕ_n) (38)
                =W_(n+m)*(ψ¯_m⊗⋯⊗ψ¯_1⊗ϕ_1⊗⋯⊗ϕ_n) (39)
                =W_(n+m)*(ψ^∗⊗ϕ). (40)

Hence, for ϕ_0∈C,ϕ_1∈𝒮(ℝ^4),…,ϕ_n∈𝒮(ℝ^(4*n)) we have
sum_(i,j=0)^nW_(i+j)*(ϕ_j^∗⊗ϕ_i) =sum_(i,j=0)^n⟨Θ_i(ϕ_i),Θ_j(ϕ_j)⟩ (41)
                                 =|sum_(i=0)^nΘ_i(ϕ_i)|^2≥0 (42)

(W4) For ϕ∈S(ℝ^(4*n)) define ϕˇ∈S(ℝ^(4*n-4)) by
ϕˇ*(x_1,…,x_n)=ϕ*(x_2-x_1,x_3-x_2,…,x_n-x_(n-1))  (43)
Define M_n∈δ(ℝ^(4*n-4)) as M_n(ϕ)=W_n(ϕˇ). If ϕ∈δ(ℝ^(4*n)), then
(ϕ^)^∼(x_1,…,x_n) =ϕ^*(x_2-x_1,x_3-x_2,…,x_n-x_(n-1)) (44)
                  =ϕ*(0,x_2-x_1,x_3-x_1,…,x_n-x_1). (45)

Hence,
M_n(ϕ^) =W_n*[ϕ*(0,x_2-x_1,x_3-x_1,…,x_n-x_1)] (46)
        =W_n*[ϕ∘(x_1,I)^(-1)]=W_n(ϕ). (47)

The proofs of W4(b) and W6 are fairly technical and will be omitted. □
We have shown that corresponding to any Wightman quantum field there exists a sequence W_n of tempered distributions on 𝒮(ℝ^(4*n)),n=0,1,…, satisfying conditions W1-W6. We shall now prove the converse. That is, a Wightman quantum field can be reconstructed from a sequence of tempered distributions satisfying W1-W6. Moreover, we shall show that Wightman quantum fields are characterized by a certain class of states on the "field algebra."
Let δ_n=δ(ℝ^(4*n)),n=0,1,…, and let δ=oplusδ_n with the operations as defined in Section 5.3. We call 𝒮 the field algebra. We showed in Section 5.3 that 𝒮 is a *-algebra. For ϕ∈𝒮_1,f∈𝒮 define
(ϕ∘f)_i=int_(ℝ^4)ϕ(a)*[(a,I)*f_i]*d*a  (48)
for i=0,1,… It is not hard to show that ϕ∘f∈𝒮 for every ϕ∈𝒮_1,f∈𝒮. Let I_s be the smallest left ideal in 𝒮 containing the set
{ϕ∘f:f∈𝒮,f_0=0,ϕ∈𝒮_1,F*ϕ(x)=0,x∈V_+}.  (49)
The ideal I_s is related to the spectrum condition. We shall also need an ideal related to locality. We say that ϕ∈δ_n and ψ∈δ_m are spacelike separated if (x_i-y_j)⋅(x_i-y_j)<0 for every (x_1,…,x_n)∈suppϕ and (y_1,…,y_m)∈suppψ. We say that f,g∈𝒮 are spacelike separated if f_0=g_0=0 and f_i,g_j are spacelike separated for every i,j>0. We denote by I_c the smallest two-sided ideal in 𝒮 containing all elements of the form f×g-g×f, where f,g are spacelike separated. Finally, we say that a state w on 𝒮 is invariant if
w(f)=w*(f∘(a,Λ)^(-1))  (50)
for every (a,Λ)∈P,f∈𝒮.
If w is a state on 𝒮 and ϕ_n∈𝒮_n we define
w(ϕ_n)=w(0,…,ϕ_n,0,…)  (51)
Let w be a state on 𝒮,ϕ∈𝒮_n and 0≤j≤n an integer. If we define
ψ(x_1,…,x_j)=w*[ϕ*(x_1,…,x_j,⋯)]  (52)
then it is not hard to show that ψ∈δ_j. We define w_j⊗w_(n-j):δ_n→C by w_j⊗w_(n-j)(ϕ)=w(ψ). Now let (Θ,D,U,h) be a Wightman quantum field. Define w_h:δ→C by
w_h(ϕ_0,ϕ_1,…)=sum_(n=0)^∞W_n(ϕ_n).  (53)
Theorem 2. 
(a).Let (Θ,D,U,h) be a Wightman quantum field. Then w_h is an invariant state on 𝒮 which annihilates the ideals I_s,I_c and satisfies:
lim_(λ→∞) w_h*(T_(j,λ*a)*ϕ)=w_j⊗w_(n-j)(ϕ)  (54)
for every spacelike a∈M^4.
(b).Conversely, if w is an invariant state on 𝒮 which annihilates the ideals I_s,I_c and satisfies (54), then there exists a Wightman quantum field (Θ,D,U,h) which is unique to within an equivalence such that
⟨Θ(ϕ)*h,h⟩=w(ϕ)  (55)
for every ϕ∈𝒮_1.
Proof. (a) Clearly w_h is linear on δ and satisfies w_h(1)=1. To show that w_h is positive, suppose f=(ϕ_0,…,ϕ_n,0,0,…)∈𝒮. Then
f^∗×f=(|ϕ_0|^2,ϕ_0^∗*ϕ_1+ϕ_1^∗*ϕ_0,…,sum_(i+j=n)ϕ_i^∗⊗ϕ_j,…)  (56)
It follows from W1 that
w_h*(f^∗×f)=sum_(i,j=0)W_(i+j)*(ϕ_i^∗⊗ϕ_j)≥0  (57)
The invariance of w_h follows from W3. We now show that w_h annihilates I_s. Let ϕ∈𝒮_1 satisfy F*ϕ(x)=0 for x∈V_+. Then by the spectrum condition W4
intϕ(a)*U(a,I)*d*a =intϕ(a)[inte^(i*p⋅a)*E*(d*p)]*d*a (58)
                   =int[inte^(i*p⋅a)*ϕ(a)*d*a]*E*(d*p)=intF*ϕ(p)*E*(d*p)=0 (59)

Now let f=ϕ_1⊗⋯⊗ϕ_n∈δ_n. Then by covariance
0 =⟨intϕ(a)*U(a,I)*d*a*Θ(ϕ_1)*⋯*Θ(ϕ_n)*h,h⟩ (60)
  =⟨intϕ(a)*Θ*(ϕ_1∘(a,I)^(-1))*⋯*Θ*(ϕ_n∘(a,I)^(-1))*d*a*h,h⟩ (61)
  =intϕ(a)*W_n*((a,I)*f)=W_n(intϕ(a)(a,I)*f*d*a) (62)
  =W_n*(ϕ∘f)=w_h*(ϕ∘f). (63)

Since w_h*(ϕ∘f)=0 for every f∈𝒮 and since the kernel of w_h is a left ideal, w_h(I_s)=0. To show that w_h annihilates I_c, let ϕ,ψ∈δ_1 be spacelike separated and let ϕ_1,ϕ_2∈𝒮_1. Then by W5 we have
 w_h*[ϕ_1⊗(ϕ⊗ψ-ψ⊗ϕ)⊗ϕ_2] (64)
 =W_4*(ϕ_1⊗ϕ⊗ψ⊗ϕ_2)-W_4*(ϕ_1⊗ψ⊗ϕ⊗ϕ_2)=0 (65)

The general case follows similarly. Hence w_h(I_c)=0. Equation (54) follows from W6.
(b) Let w be a state on 𝔖 satisfying the given conditions. We proceed using the GNS construction. Let D be the vector space D=δ/G with inner product ⟨f,g⟩=w*(g^∗×f), let ℋ be the Hilbert space completion of D and let h=[1]. Define Θ(ϕ)=π(ϕ),ϕ∈𝒮_1, where π is the GNS construction. Conditions (1) and (2) for a Wightman quantum field hold. We now define a unitary representation U of P on H. For [f]∈D, (a,Λ)∈P, define U(a,Λ)[f]=[f∘(a,Λ)^(-1)]. The transformation U(a,Λ) is well-defined since w is invariant and (a,Λ) leaves the left ideal G∩I_s∩I_c invariant. It is clear that U(a,Λ) is linear and leaves D invariant. Moreover, U(a,Λ) is isometric on D since
⟨U(a,Λ)[f],U(a,Λ)[g]⟩ =w*[f∘(a,Λ)^(-1^∗)×g∘(a,Λ)^(-1)] (66)
                      =w*[(f^∗×g)∘(a,Λ)^(-1)]=w*(f^∗×g)=⟨f,g⟩. (67)

Since D is dense in ℋ,U(a,Λ) has a unique unitary extension to ℋ. To show that U is a unitary representation of P we have
U(a_1,Λ_1)*U(a_2,Λ_2)[f] =U(a_1,Λ_1)*[f∘(a_2,Λ_2)^(-1)] (68)
                         =[f∘(a_2,Λ_2)^(-1)∘(a_1,Λ_1)^(-1)] (69)
                         =[f∘((a_1,Λ_1)(a_2,Λ_2))^(-1)] (70)
                         =U[(a_1,Λ_1)(a_2,Λ_2)][f]. (71)

The representation is continuous since w is continuous in ℋ. Moreover,
U(a,Λ)*h=U(a,Λ)[1]=[1∘(a,Λ)^(-1)]=[1]=h  (72)
and hence conditions 3(a) and 3(b) hold. To show that 3(c) holds, we have for every f∈D
U(a,Λ)*Θ(ϕ)*U(a,Λ)^∗[f] =U(a,Λ)*Θ(ϕ)*[f∘(a,Λ)] (73)
                        =U(a,Λ)*[ϕ×f∘(a,Λ)] (74)
                        =[ϕ×f∘(a,Λ)]∘(a,Λ)^(-1) (75)
                        =[ϕ∘(a,Λ)^(-1)×f]=Θ*[ϕ∘(a,Λ)^(-1)][f]. (76)

To show that (4) holds, let F*ϕ(x)=0 for x∈V_+. Then for every g∈𝒮_1 we have
intϕ(a)*U(a,I)[g]*d*a =intϕ(a)*[g∘(a,I)^(-1)]*d*a (77)
                      =ϕ∘g=0 (78)

since ϕ∘g∈I_s⊆G. Since g∈𝒮_1 was arbitrary, it follows that intϕ(a)*U(a,I)*d*a=0. Therefore, suppF^(-1)*U(a,I)⊆V_+, which is equivalent to the spectrum condition. For (5), if ϕ,ψ∈𝒮_1 are spacelike separated, then
‖Θ(ϕ)*Θ(ψ)[g]-Θ(ψ)*Θ(ϕ)[g]‖^2 =w*(g⊗(ψ⊗ϕ-ϕ⊗ψ)⊗(ψ⊗ϕ-ϕ⊗ψ)⊗g) (79)
                              =0 (80)

since ψ⊗ϕ-ϕ⊗ψ∈I_c. Condition (6) follows from (54). □
As a corollary we obtain the converse of Theorem 1.
Corollary 3. If W_n,n=0,1,… is a sequence of tempered distributions on δ(ℝ^(4*n)),n=0,1,…, satisfying W1-W6, then there exists a unique (to within equivalence) Wightman quantum field (Θ,D,U,h) such that
W_n*(ϕ_1⊗⋯⊗ϕ_n)=⟨Θ(ϕ_1)*⋯*Θ(ϕ_n)*h,h⟩.  (81)
Proof. Define w_h:δ→C by (53). As in the proof of Theorem 2(a), w_h is an invariant state which annihilates the ideals I_s,I_c and satisfies (54). The result follows from Theorem 2(b). □
