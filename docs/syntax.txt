1. Set Theoretic
2. Containment: Subsets and Supersets

Containment of A by B (i.e. every element of A is in B) is written

A⊂B

or, allowing equality,

A⊆B

Equivalently, this can be expressed as

B⊃A

or, expressing the fact that the sets B and A are possiby equal

B⊇A

2.2 Measure-Theoretic Considerations

The statement requires qualification based on context:

2.2.1 Finite Sets

For finite sets with A ⊂ B, the cardinality satisfies |A| < |B|
necessarily.

Proof: Suppose A ⊂ B with both finite. By definition of proper subset,
A ⊆ B and A ≠ B. Since A ⊆ B, every element of A is in B. Since A ≠ B,
there exists b ∈ B with b ∉ A. Thus B contains all elements of A plus
at least one additional element. For finite sets, this forces |B| ≥
|A| + 1, hence |A| < |B|.

2.2.2 Infinite Sets

For infinite sets, proper subsets can have equal cardinality to the
superset.

Counterexample: The even natural numbers form a proper subset of ℕ:
{2,4,6,...} ⊂ ℕ. However, the bijection f(n) = 2n demonstrates
|{2,4,6,...}| = |ℕ|.

Similarly, ℕ ⊂ ℤ but |ℕ| = |ℤ| (both countably infinite).

2.2.3 Measure Theory

For measurable sets in ℝⁿ with Lebesgue measure μ, proper subsets can
have equal measure.

Counterexample: Let A = [0,1] \ {1/2} and B = [0,1]. Then A ⊂ B but
μ(A) = μ(B) = 1 since singleton sets have measure zero.

The original statement holds only for finite sets. For infinite
cardinalities or continuous measures, proper containment does not
imply strictly smaller "volume."
