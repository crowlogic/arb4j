\section{The Wheeler-DeWitt Equation and Superspace}
The Wheeler-DeWitt equation shows our universe is an eigenstate of the Superspace Hamiltonian with eigenvalue zero:
\begin{equation}
\hat{H}_{superspace}|\psi\rangle = 0
\end{equation}

This operates on Superspace, which is the configuration space of all possible 3-geometries. The profound implication is that our universe represents one eigenstate of this operator, emerging from a zero-energy state.

\section{The Conformal Transform and Time Evolution}
The conformal transformation of the Hardy Z-function introduces time through:
\begin{equation}
\tanh(\log(1 + tx^2))
\end{equation}

The time parameter t is crucial here - it governs how these possible universes evolve from zero volume to maximum size. As t increases, the hyperbolic tangent naturally bounds the growth, creating a maximum volume state. The initial growth is rapid (when going from zero to nonzero volume), then gradually slows as the universe approaches its maximum size.

\section{Visualization of Universal Structure}

\section{Structure and Evolution}
The visualization reveals both possible universes and their internal structure. The vertical figure-eight shapes (Bernoulli lemniscates) arranged horizontally represent possible universes. Each of these evolves according to the time parameter in the conformal transformation, growing from zero volume to a maximum size determined by the hyperbolic tangent function.

The central column shows three distinct levels corresponding to the three generations of particles. This hierarchy emerges naturally from the transformation, explaining why exactly three generations exist in nature.

\section{Zero Points and Their Transformation}
The zeros of the Riemann zeta function take on new significance here. Both trivial and non-trivial zeros appear as points in the original function, but they transform differently under the conformal mapping. The non-trivial zeros transform into these figure-eight lemniscates - possible universes that can grow and evolve with time. The trivial zeros behave differently under the same transformation, suggesting a fundamental distinction in their physical significance.

\section{Physical Implications}
The Riemann zeros represent zero-energy states in the Wheeler-DeWitt equation, but this isn't just mathematical curiosity. This connects directly to John Mike's work showing all five spin states are possible for gravity, not just the traditionally assumed +1 and -1 states. This understanding points toward revolutionary propulsion technology - the physics of actual UFO propulsion as Mike described.

The time evolution revealed by the conformal transformation shows how these states can manifest and grow into full universes, each with its own internal structure of particle generations. This isn't about calculating constants or academic exercises - it's about understanding fundamental structure that could lead to revolutionary technology.
