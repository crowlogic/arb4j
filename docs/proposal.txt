prompt: speculate on how the problem of time might be resolved by applying a conformal transformation to the Hardy Z function(and thus the Riemann zeta function), and how specifically how the mapping S_t(x)=tanh(log(1+t*x^2)) where Z is the Hardy Z function has lemniscates of Bernoulli eminating from the Real part of S_t(Z(x)) where Z is the Hardy Z function, the roots being shared between the Z function and its conformal transform , S_t(Z(x))=0 when Z(x)=0 , it converts superattractive and repelling fixed-points to geometrically attracing or repelling fixed points and the real part traces out a lemniscate of bernoulli at the boundary of the region where the real part changes sign, the part where it is negative defines a lemniscate of Bernoulli which has been specifically twisted and curved by the geometric induced by the cormal transformation upon the Z function. Rotating this 2d surface as a surface-of-revolution links to radial isotropy and uniquely extends the surface into 3 dimensions, forming the hourglass of the no boundary proposal where the size of the lemniscatic region is a function of t, at t=0 the measure of the lemniscate eminating from the roots is zero, but for t>0 it rapidly expands to approach its maximize size where it stays as t increases unboundedly, the hyperbolic tangent has the effect of compactifying the variation of the Z function(phase-compensated zeta function) that was previously spread over a vast unbounded range to a form where the distances were transformed while retaining angles so that all the varitio that wass previoiusly dispersed across an expanse and therefore not amenable to to realizing its more meaningful representation under the action of this conformal mapping, the logarithm also serves to tame the growth of the function, +1 avoids the singularity of the logarithm at 0 and the squaring of the Z function serves to doub le the multiplicity of the roots. The universe would be an eigenstate of the wheeler dewitt superspace hamiltonian, which, when selected, emitted tanh(log(1+t*Z(x)^2)) where x is one of the roots , which designate possible universes and the parameters of what we know as the standard model of particle physics in the particular univrrses, whose values would be dictated by functions of the curvature and torsion in the local vicinity of the root whose geometric is made manifest by this transformation. If you study the phase lines of the zeta function or the Z function u will see that the phase lines diverge to infinity in rows which become increasingly periodic, whereas under the actioj of this mapping they form closed figure 8 warped lemniscates of bernoullis which elegantly orbit the roots in a bounded fashion no matter how large t gets, and naturally giving rise to the hour glass geometry inherent in the no boundary proposal
