    We derive a simple fundamental equation for a flying saucer. The equation
    is:

    <\equation*>
      v/G=k*M*f*a<rsup|2>/r<rsup|2>
    </equation*>

    where the <math|v> is the velocity of the craft, <math|G> the
    gravitational constant, <math|M> the negative gravitational mass,
    <math|a> the diameter of the rotating ring, <math|f> frequency of
    rotation, <math|r> the radius of the negative vector potential bubble,
    and <math|k> a constant of value 1 with units of m/kg. From the equation
    it is possible to deduce that:\ 

    <\enumerate-numeric>
      <item> inertia can be eliminated

  <section|<with|font-series|bold|Eliminating Inertia>>

  Bondi (1) has show that the existence of negative gravitational mass does
  not violate general relativity. This conclusion has not been refuted.

  Sciama in 1957 did the first calculation that showed that the total matter
  in the universe caused inertia (2). His calculation was non-relativistic.
  Einstein, although he never explicitly included Mach's Principle as part
  General Relativity, says on page 102 of <with|font-shape|italic|The Meaning
  of Relativity> that inertia was mediated by the time derivative of the
  vector potential <with|font-series|bold|A>, that is, by gravity (3). In a
  recent paper entitled "On Mach's principle: Inertia as gravitation", a
  Spanish group did a fully relativistic analysis with linearized Einstein
  equations. They used the time derivative of the vector potential,
  <math|h<rsub|0*i,0>>, but also a small scalar counter term
  <math|h<rsub|00*i>>, retarded potentials, and included consideration of
  dark energy. They came within 10% of verifying
  <with|font-series|bold|Mach's Principle>. Therefore the principle that
  gravitation causes inertia is well established.

  Following Sciama (4) and Jefimenko (5,6) we have the vector potential

  <\equation>
    A=*<frac|G|c<rsup|2>><big|int><frac|\<rho\>*v|r>*<space|0.17em>d*V
  </equation>

  where <math|\<rho\>> is the mass density and <math|v> its velocity. To find
  the vector potential created by the remote stars postulated by
  <with|font-series|bold|Mach's principle>, Sciama carries out the
  integration over the mass distribution of the entire universe, assuming the
  universe to be receding with velocity -<with|font-series|bold|v>. The
  <math|v>, being constant, comes out of the integral

  <\equation>
    A=<frac|v*G|c<rsup|2>><big|int><frac|\<rho\>|r>*<space|0.17em>d*V
  </equation>

  with

  <\equation>
    \<Phi\>=G<big|int><frac|\<rho\>|r>*<space|0.17em><space|0.17em>d*V
  </equation>

  We are left with\ 

  <\equation>
    A=<frac|v*\<Phi\>|c<rsup|2>>
  </equation>

  where <math|\<Phi\>> is the universal scalar gravitational potential.
  Sciama then changes coordinates and has the test particle move with
  <with|font-series|bold|v> while the universe is stationary. The recent
  calculation (4) also uses this technique. We are going to interpret this
  equation to mean that the particle is subject to the
  <with|font-series|bold|A> vector as it moves through the universes scalar
  potential.

  Positive and negative masses repel each other through their fields, and the
  field has to be zero on the boundary. If a region of space existed around a
  gravitationally negative mass, the scalar potential would be negative and
  the <with|font-series|bold|A> vector derived from this field would be
  anti-parallel to the velocity

  <\equation>
    A=<frac|-<around|\||\<phi\>|\|>*v|c<rsup|2>>
  </equation>

  as opposed to parallel, <math|A=<frac|\<Phi\>*v|c<rsup|2>>>.

  This is to be expected as <math|\<Phi\>> and <with|font-series|bold|A> form
  a four-vector in relativity

  <\equation>
    A<rsub|\<mu\>>=<around|(|A,\<phi\>|)>
  </equation>

  so if <math|\<phi\>> is negative, so is <with|font-series|bold|A>. These
  parallel conditions are mutually exclusive; you cannot have
  <with|font-series|bold|A> parallel and ani-parallel to
  <with|font-series|bold|v> at the same time. Therefore the positive and
  negative gravity spaces would have to be disjoint. A vector potential would
  tend toward zero as we approached the boundary of the negative
  gravitational space, become zero at the boundary, and then become negative
  (or anti-parallel) inside the negative gravitational space. The parallel
  <with|font-series|bold|A(+)> vector could not exist in the negative
  gravitational space. Therefore the <with|font-series|bold|A(+)> vector
  could not mediate inertia in the negative region.

  This then provides the possibility of shielding from inertia. The
  possibility of shielding from inertia is derived from the corollary to
  <with|font-series|bold|Mach's Principle>. If the \Pdistant stars\Q, that
  is, the universal scalar background potential, <math|\<Phi\>>, causes
  inertia, then the corollary is that in the in the absence of the effect of
  the \Pdistant stars\Q, or the effect of <math|\<Phi\>>, there is no
  inertia.

  We see that as the disparity between the size of positive and negative
  masses increases, the field around the negative mass shrinks.

  The problem is that any finite amount of negative mass, tons or even
  hundreds of tons, would have a gravity field that would be miniscule
  compared to the field of the astronomical quantities of gravitationally
  positive mass. The negative field would actually be confined to within the
  negative matter. There would not be a region of negative gravitational
  field in which to shield the UFO from the positive field generated by the
  universe that everything is usually immersed in.

  If we look at the definition of <with|font-series|bold|A>, we see that
  there is a possible multiplier, the velocity <with|font-series|bold|v>.

  <\equation>
    <text|<with|font-series|bold|A>>=<big|int><frac|\<rho\><text|<with|font-series|bold|v>>|r>*<space|0.17em>d*V
  </equation>

  If we take a negative ring and spin it, we create a magnetic dipole
  <with|font-series|bold|A> field. If we spin the ring faster and faster,
  over a million revolutions per second, we can get a finite field. Therefore
  we create a bubble in space of negative vector potential. If an object were
  to be within this bubble, it would be shielded from the positive vector
  potential arising out of the universe's background scalar potential. In
  other words, the object would be shielded from the fields that create
  inertia; therefore it would not be subject to inertia.

  When we spin the mass, the mass is now within the bubble, and therefore has
  no inertia. Without inertia the inertial mass and moment of inertia of the
  spinning body are zero, and consequently there are no centrifugal forces to
  tear it apart. The possible rates of spin can be very high, the only
  limitation being that the rim velocity of the spinning body could not
  exceed the speed of light.

  <section|Deriving The Equation>

  We now use the fact that a spinning ring of negative mass can create a
  negative gravitational field to derive the fundamental equation for flying
  saucer.

  At the boundary between the positive and negative gravitational spaces the
  total vector potential is zero. Labeling the A vectors\ 

  with + and - to keep track of where they operate

  <\equation>
    (A+)+<around|(|A-|)>=0
  </equation>

  <\equation>
    <around|(|A+|)>=-<around|(|A-|)>
  </equation>

  On the left hand side of the equation we have the vector potential of the
  universe which is given by

  <\equation>
    A*<around|(|+|)>=<frac|\<Phi\>*v|c<rsup|2>>
  </equation>

  where v the velocity of the craft.

  The flying saucer generates a negative vector potential A(-) by spinning
  ring of negative mass. The spinning ring is a gravitational dipole that
  generates the A(-)

  <\equation>
    -A*<around|(|-|)>=<frac|\<mu\>|r<rsup|2>>
  </equation>

  Since the equations of the gravitational weak field approximation are
  identical to Maxwell's, we can take over this equation. The normal magnetic
  dipole of a current loop is given by, where I is the current.

  <\equation>
    \<mu\>=\<mu\><rsub|0>*I*<around|(|A*r*e*a|)>
  </equation>

  The shape of the negative mass in the saucer is probably a flat ring,
  something like a freesbee. (You might check out the hundreds of photograph
  of flying saucers.) <with|font-series|bold|We will simplify our calculation
  by replacing the flat ring with a thin massive ring of linear mass
  <math|\<lambda\>>>. We replace <math|\<mu\><rsub|0>> by k, which we will
  discuss in a NOTE below, and I by a current of mass,
  <math|I<rsub|m>=\<lambda\>*v>.

  <\equation>
    \<lambda\>=<text|mass/circumference>=<frac|M|2 \<pi\>a>
  </equation>

  \;

  The area is <math|\<pi\>*a<rsup|2>>. Therefore the mass current is

  <\equation>
    I<rsub|m>=<frac|M*v|2*\<pi\>*a>
  </equation>

  So gravitational magnetic dipole moment will be

  <\equation>
    <tabular|<tformat|<table|<row|<cell|\<mu\>>|<cell|=<frac|k*M*v|<around|(|2*\<pi\>*a|)>*\<pi\>*a<rsup|2>>>>|<row|<cell|>|<cell|=k*<around*|(|<frac|M|2>|)>*v*a>>|<row|<cell|>|<cell|=<frac|k*M*v*a|2>>>>>>
  </equation>

  The result on the right hand side for the negative vector potential is

  <\equation>
    -A*<around|(|-|)>=<frac|\<mu\>|r<rsup|2>>
  </equation>

  Because we have a negative mass (the sign of M is negative) which cancels
  the minus sign in front of A(-) and therefore

  <\equation>
    A*<around|(|-|)>=<frac|k*M*v*a|2*r<rsup|2>>
  </equation>

  We can express the formula in terms of the rotation frequency f. The
  velocity

  <\equation>
    v=a*\<omega\>=a*<around|(|2*\<pi\>*f|)>=2*\<pi\>*a*f
  </equation>

  \ where <math|\<omega\>> is the angular velocity. Then

  <\equation>
    <tabular|<tformat|<table|<row|<cell|A*<around|(|-|)>>|<cell|=<frac|k*M*<around|(|2*\<pi\>*a*f|)>*a|2*r<rsup|2>>>>|<row|<cell|>|<cell|=<frac|k*\<pi\>*M*f*a<rsup|2>|r<rsup|2>>>>>>>
  </equation>

  The left hand side of the equation A of the universe is

  <\equation>
    A*<around|(|+|)>=<frac|v*\<Phi\>|c<rsup|2>>=<frac|v|G>
  </equation>

  since from Sciama (4) <math|>

  <\equation>
    <frac|\<Phi\>|c<rsup|2>>=<frac|1|G>
  </equation>

  We have the derived the fundamental equation for a flying saucer:

  <\equation>
    <text|<math|<frac|v|G>=>><frac|k*\<pi\>*M*f*a<rsup|2>|r<rsup|2>>
  </equation>

  The equations for the vector potential <with|font-series|bold|A> are vector
  equations but for our formula we need consider only the scalar part as the
  vector aspect is only a spatial component of order unity.\ 

  <section|APPLICATIONS>

  <subsection|UFO Without Inertia>

  In order to test whether a flying saucer is able to overcome inertia, we
  apply the formula to the worst case scenario, the smallest flying saucer
  reported with a ring radius of say 5 meters, or total diameter of 30 feet.
  Because the generation of the negative vector potential
  <with|font-series|bold|A(-)> depends on the negative mass which has to be
  rotated, a larger UFO which could have a more massive ring, could possibly
  not have to rotate the ring quite as fast and still be able to overcome
  inertia. Also the speeds recorded by radar in Belgium in 1990 where for Big
  Black Triangle type UFOs.

  We are limited by size (and mass) of the ring and the rotation frequency
  because the rim velocity cannot exceed the speed of light. The question now
  is, what kind of a rotational speed do we need for the spinning ring to
  create a field that equals the field from the universal, scalar potential,
  repelling it, and create a space in which the UFO can hide
