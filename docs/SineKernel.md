title: Eigenfunction and Eigenvalue of the Sine Kernel
---

# Introduction

The sine kernel is a significant element in the study of Gaussian
processes and random matrices. It is defined by the integral operator
with kernel: $$K (x, y) = \frac{\sin (x - y)}{\pi (x - y)}$$

# Eigenfunction and Eigenvalue

An important eigenfunction of the sine kernel is $\sin (x)$, which
satisfies the integral equation:
$$\int_{- \infty}^{\infty} \frac{\sin (x - y)}{\pi (x - y)} \sin (y) 
  \hspace{0.17em} dy = \sin (x)$$ This shows that $\sin (x)$ is an
eigenfunction of the integral operator with the sine kernel, and its
corresponding eigenvalue is 1.

# Identity Validation

The identity involving the sine kernel can be verified through:
$$\int_{- \infty}^{\infty} \frac{\sin (x - y) \sin y}{(x - y) \pi^2 y} 
  \hspace{0.17em} dy = \frac{\sin x}{x \pi}$$ This integral represents a
convolution of the sine function under the sine kernel, emphasizing the
role of the sine function and its spectral properties in the context of
the sine kernel.
