\section{Introduction}
The physics of negative mass propulsion presents a revolutionary approach to understanding unconventional aerial phenomena. As demonstrated by Bondi (1957), negative masses are fully consistent with general relativity[2]. The relationship between gravitational and inertial mass, alongside vector potential generation from spinning negative mass, can lead to revolutionary propulsion systems.

\section{Vector Potential Theory}
The magnetic vector potential A can be expressed as the curl of a vector function, consistent with Ampère's Law[1]. This fundamental principle extends to the behavior of negative mass systems, where the vector potential generated by spinning negative mass creates unique gravitational effects[4].

\section{Zigzag Trajectory Analysis}
\subsection{Historical Documentation}
The Center for UFO Studies (CUFOS) database contains over 209,000 eyewitness reports that consistently describe distinctive zigzag movement patterns[5]. These reports show remarkable consistency in describing:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Sharp 90-degree turns
    \item Straight-line segments between turns
    \item Step-wise escape trajectories
\end{itemize}

\section{Movement Mechanics}
The proposed mechanism manipulates vector potentials through spinning negative mass discs. According to Mike (2011), gravitationally negative mass, when spun at high speed, allows for inertial negation[5]. This explains:
\begin{itemize}
    \item All-directional movement capability
    \item Discrete jump-turn-jump patterns
    \item Absence of smooth turns due to drive physics
\end{itemize}

\section{Mathematical Framework}
Following Farnes (2018), we can express the fundamental equations[2]:

\subsection{Vector Potential Generation}
\[
A_\mu = -\frac{\mu_0}{4\pi} \int \frac{J^\mu(x')}{|x-x'|} d^3x'
\]

\subsection{Inertial Mass Modification}
\[
m_i = m_g(1 + \alpha A_\mu A^\mu)
\]

\subsection{Field Equations}
\[
\nabla \times \mathbf{A} = \mathbf{B}
\]
\[
\mathbf{F} = q(\mathbf{E} + \mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{B})
\]

\section{Observational Correlation}
The zigzag patterns represent optimal trajectories for:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Minimizing energy expenditure
    \item Maximizing escape efficiency from gravitational wells
    \item Maintaining drive system stability
\end{itemize}

\section{Conservation Laws}
As demonstrated by Forward (1990), negative masses are consistent with both conservation of momentum and energy[2]. The effective inertial mass manipulation through vector potentials provides trajectory control without violating fundamental physical laws.

\section{Conclusion}
The unification of negative mass theories provides a coherent framework matching observational data. As noted by recent researchers, negative mass solutions may indicate either a real physical phenomenon or point to a superseding theory that can be modeled by effective negative masses[2].
