  TODO: \ Possible Universes Are Zero Energy States of the Superspace
  Hamiltonian of the Wheeler DeWitt equation Which is Solved By A Conformal
  Transform of the Hardy Z function, making a direct corresponding between
  the Riemann zeros and possible universes whereby what is presently
  considered to be the Standard Model of particle physics has its parameters
  determined by functions of the curvature and torsion of the conformally
  transformed Z function in neighborhood of the roots of the \ Z function,
  which are equivalent with the roots in the sense that the sets of roots of
  both the Z function and its conformally transformed version are the same,
  thus multiplicity 1 roots in Z become multiplcity 2 roots in S(Z(t)) where
  <math|S<rsub|t><around*|(|x|)>=tanh<around*|(|log<around*|(|1+t
  x<rsup|2>|)>|)>.>

  The universe emerges through the hourglass shape inherent in the
  no-boundary proposal. This shape arises from geometric origins through the
  transformation given by the hyperbolic tangent of the logarithm of
  <math|<around|(|1+t*x<rsup|2>|)>>. As <math|t> goes from 0 to infinity, the
  universe is generated by applying the real part of this function to the
  Hardy Z-function. This application creates a structure where the roots have
  lemniscates of Bernoulli emanating from them, with corresponding hyperbolas
  in the imaginary part.

  This conformal mapping transforms the phase lines of the Hardy Z-function,
  which usually diverge to infinity, into closed curves that loop around and
  through the origin given by the location of the zero. The size of these
  lemniscates grows very rapidly as <math|t> increases from 0. Due to the
  squashing nature of the hyperbolic tangent combined with the logarithm,
  this becomes a rational function that converts the divergent phase lines
  into closed lemniscates orbiting the roots.

  This structure explains inflation: the volume of this configuration is
  dramatically larger than the values close to it in space. The closer to the
  origin, the greater the relative distances, while further from the origin,
  the relative distances become correspondingly smaller. When forming a
  surface of revolution by revolving the two-dimensional real part, and
  defining this surface as the points where the real part is negative or
  zero, we get the lemniscate. Revolving these Bernoulli lemniscates
  emanating from the roots generates the hourglass shape.

  This hourglass, symmetric on both sides, represents our universe. Through a
  conformal mapping, the interior of this hourglass (or its closure together
  with its boundary) can be mapped onto a sphere - our universe - with the
  umbilical point corresponding to the Big Bang in this mapping.

  The parameter <math|t> in this transformation is literally time itself,
  with <math|t=0> corresponding to the Big Bang. As <math|t> increases
  unboundedly, the universe expands, but due to the analytic structure of the
  function (specifically the composition of logarithm and hyperbolic
  tangent), our universe will never reach its maximum size. However,
  practically all variation in the function ceases at some point, as evident
  in the geometry when plotted.

  The composition of logarithm and hyperbolic tangent is crucial - it's not
  just about limiting growth. The logarithm specifically creates the
  lemniscate patterns that are fundamental to the living structure of the
  universe. This mathematical structure completely upends scenarios of
  universal heat death or "cold death." The universe isn't heading toward
  some thermodynamic end state because these lemniscates, created by the
  logarithm in the transformation, show eternal dynamic structure. These
  aren't just static patterns but fundamental living forms.

  The transformation <math|tanh <around|(|log <around|(|1+t*x<rsup|2>|)>|)>>
  creates eternal dynamics through its specific composition:

  <\itemize>
    <item>The <math|<around|(|1+t*x<rsup|2>|)>> term prevents logarithm
    singularity at zero and handles both attractive and repulsive fixed
    points

    <item>The logarithm reduces the range of large values and converts
    multiplicative behavior to additive

    <item>The hyperbolic tangent squashes everything into a bounded range
    while preserving the essential dynamic structure in the form of the
    angles being preserved whereas the distances are transformed
  </itemize>

  This composition transforms the wild behavior of the Hardy Z-function's
  phase lines into something studiable by making super-attractive/repulsive
  fixed points into geometrically attractive ones that can be analyzed using
  Koenigs' linearization theorem. The universe isn't a machine running down -
  it's a living mathematical structure, and these equations show us exactly
  how and why.

  The real part's behavior outside the negative regions, rapidly approaching
  unity, shows how previously "unstudyable" variations become comprehensible.
  What was spread across an infinite expanse in the complex plane of the
  Hardy Z-function gets mapped into a finite, studiable structure. This
  mapping doesn't just describe the universe - it makes visible what was
  previously invisible due to being spread across infinite ranges.
