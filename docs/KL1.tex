\section{Karhunen - Lo√®ve Expansion}

Let $X(t)$ be an arbitrary mean square continuous random process given on the interval $a \leq t \leq b$ of the $t$-axis, and let $B(t,s) = \langle X(t)X(s) \rangle$ be a correlation function of $X(t)$. Consider the integral equation

\begin{equation}
\int_a^b B(t,s)\psi(s)ds = \lambda\psi(t), \quad a \leq t \leq b.
\end{equation}

Equation (4.384) is a linear integral equation with a symmetric (or, in the complex case, Hermitian) positive definite kernel. According to the general theory of such integral equations, it has a denumerable set of nonnegative eigenvalues $\lambda_j$, $j = 1, 2, ...,$ which are matched by a denumerable set of eigenfunctions $\psi_j(t)$, $j = 1, 2, ...,$ forming a complete orthonormal set of functions on $[a,b]$. Hence, any square integrable function can be expanded into a series in functions $\psi_j(t)$, and
