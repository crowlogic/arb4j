Fundamental Results

Definition (Resolution of the Identity)
---------------------------------------
Let A(·): D(A) → H be a self-adjoint operator on Hilbert space H. The **resolution of the identity** (projection-valued spectral measure) is 
the family of orthogonal projections constructed as follows:

Step 1: For λ ∉ σ_{A(·)} and any ψ ∈ H, define the resolvent operation
    R_{A(·)}(λ, ψ) = φ  where  A(φ) − λφ = ψ.

Step 2: For an interval (a, b] and any ψ ∈ H, define
    E_{A(·)}((a, b], ψ) = s-lim_{ε→0⁺} (1/2πi) ∫ₐᵇ [R_{A(·)}(λ + iε, ψ) − R_{A(·)}(λ − iε, ψ)] dλ,
where s-lim denotes strong operator limit.

Step 3: For general Borel sets B ⊆ ℝ and any ψ ∈ H, with disjoint partitions {(a_k, b_k]} of B,
    E_{A(·)}(B, ψ) = s-lim_{n→∞} ∑_{k=1}^n E_{A(·)}((a_k, b_k], ψ).

Properties: For all ψ ∈ H and Borel sets B, B₁, B₂,
  1. E_{A(·)}(B, E_{A(·)}(B, ψ)) = E_{A(·)}(B, ψ) and ⟨E_{A(·)}(B, ψ), φ⟩ = ⟨ψ, E_{A(·)}(B, φ)⟩
  2. E_{A(·)}(B₁ ∩ B₂, ψ) = E_{A(·)}(B₁, E_{A(·)}(B₂, ψ))
  3. E_{A(·)}(⋃ᵢ Bᵢ, ψ) = ∑ᵢ E_{A(·)}(Bᵢ, ψ) for disjoint Bᵢ
  4. Spectral localization: σ_{A(·),B} ⊆ closure(B)
  5. A(ψ) = ∫_ℝ λ dE_{A(·)}(λ, ψ)

Theorem (Nelson’s Theorem)
--------------------------
Let A(·) be a symmetric operator on a Hilbert space H with domain D(A) dense in H. If there exists a core 𝔇 ⊆ D(A) for A(·) such that:
  1. 𝔇 is dense in H
  2. A(𝔇) ⊆ 𝔇 (invariance)
  3. For some λ with Im(λ) ≠ 0, the range of (A(φ) − λφ) |_{φ ∈ 𝔇} is dense in H
Then A(·) is essentially self-adjoint on 𝔇.

Corollary: If {U_t(ψ) : t ∈ ℝ, ψ ∈ H} is a strongly continuous one-parameter unitary group and A(·) is its infinitesimal generator, then A(·) 
is essentially self-adjoint.

Theorem (Stone’s Theorem)
-------------------------
Let H be a Hilbert space. There is a bijective correspondence between:
  1. Self-adjoint operators A(·): D(A) → H
  2. Strongly continuous one-parameter unitary groups with U_t(ψ): H → H for each t ∈ ℝ, ψ ∈ H
The correspondence is given by U_t^{A(·)}(ψ) = exp(it A(ψ)) and A(ψ) = −i (d/dt) U_t^{A(·)}(ψ) |_{t=0}.

Proof Sketch:
-------------
Given a strongly continuous unitary group {U_t(ψ)}, define the generator
    A(ψ) = −i lim_{t→0} (U_t(ψ) − ψ)/t
on domain D(A) = {ψ ∈ H : lim_{t→0} (U_t(ψ) − ψ)/t exists}.

Symmetry: For ψ, φ ∈ D(A),
    ⟨A(ψ), φ⟩ = −i lim_{t→0} (⟨U_t(ψ), φ⟩ − ⟨ψ, φ⟩)/t
              = −i lim_{t→0} (⟨ψ, U_{−t}(φ)⟩ − ⟨ψ, φ⟩)/t
              = −i ⟨ψ, lim_{t→0} (U_{−t}(φ) − φ)/t⟩
              = ⟨ψ, A(φ)⟩

By Nelson’s theorem, A(·) is essentially self-adjoint.

Conversely, for self-adjoint A(·), define
    U_t^{A(·)}(ψ) := ∫_ℝ exp(itλ) dE_{A(·)}(λ, ψ)
using the spectral resolution.

Definition (Stationary Process)
-------------------------------
A stochastic process {X_t : t ∈ ℝ} is weakly stationary if:
  1. E[X_t] is constant
  2. Cov(X_t, X_s) = γ(t − s) depends only on t − s
  3. E[|X_t|²] < ∞ for all t

Definition (Orthogonal Random Measure)
--------------------------------------
A complex-valued orthogonal random measure Z(B) on ℝ satisfies:
  1. E[Z(A) · conj(Z(B))] = 0 for disjoint Borel sets A, B
  2. E[|Z(A)|²] = F(A) where F(·) is a finite measure
  3. Z(⋃ᵢ Aᵢ) = ∑ᵢ Z(Aᵢ) in L² for disjoint Aᵢ
  4. E[Z(A)²] = 0 for all Borel sets A

Spectral Representation of Stationary Processes
----------------------------------------------

Theorem (Complex Spectral Representation)
-----------------------------------------
Let {X_t} be a zero-mean weakly stationary process as above. There exists a unique orthogonal random measure Z(B) as above such that:
    X_t = ∫_ℝ exp(iλt) dZ(λ)
where the integral converges in L².

Proof Sketch:
-------------
Let H = closure(span{X_t : t ∈ ℝ}) with inner product ⟨X_s, X_t⟩ = γ(t − s).
Define translation operations T_h(ψ) for each h ∈ ℝ and ψ ∈ H by T_h(X_t) = X_{t+h}.
Stationarity ensures {T_h(ψ)} forms a strongly continuous unitary group.

By Stone’s theorem, there exists a unique self-adjoint generator A_T(·): D(A_T) → H such that
    T_h(ψ) = U_h^{A_T(·)}(ψ) = exp(ih A_T(ψ))

The spectral theorem provides E_{A_T(·)}(λ, ψ) such that
    A_T(ψ) = ∫_ℝ λ dE_{A_T(·)}(λ, ψ)

Define Z(B) = E_{A_T(·)}(B, X₀) for Borel sets B. Then
    X_t = T_t(X₀) = U_t^{A_T(·)}(X₀)
        = exp(it A_T(X₀))
        = ∫_ℝ exp(iλt) dE_{A_T(·)}(λ, X₀)
        = ∫_ℝ exp(iλt) dZ(λ)

Lemma (Real Process Symmetry)
-----------------------------
If {X_t} is real-valued and satisfies the above, then Z(−B) = conj(Z(B)) for any Borel set B.

Proof:
------
Since X_t is real, X_t = conj(X_t). From the spectral representation:
    X_t = ∫_ℝ exp(iλt) dZ(λ) = conj(∫_ℝ exp(iλt) dZ(λ)) = ∫_ℝ exp(−iλt) dconj(Z(λ))
Let μ = −λ:
    X_t = ∫_ℝ exp(iμt) dconj(Z(−μ))
By uniqueness, dZ(μ) = dconj(Z(−μ)), so Z(B) = conj(Z(−B)).

Real Orthogonal Process Construction
------------------------------------

Definition (Real Orthogonal Random Measures)
-------------------------------------------
Given a complex orthogonal random measure Z(B) on [0, ∞) associated with a real-valued stationary process as above, define for any Borel set B ⊆ [0, ∞):
    U(B) = Z(B) + conj(Z(B)) = 2·Re(Z(B))
    V(B) = i·(conj(Z(B)) − Z(B)) = 2·Im(Z(B))

Theorem (Real Spectral Representation)
--------------------------------------
For a real-valued weakly stationary process {X_t} as above, there exist real-valued orthogonal random measures U(B) and V(B) as above such that:
    X_t = ∫₀^∞ cos(λt) dU(λ) + ∫₀^∞ sin(λt) dV(λ)

Proof:
------
From the complex spectral representation and Z(−λ) = conj(Z(λ)):
    X_t = ∫_{−∞}^∞ exp(iλt) dZ(λ)
        = ∫₀^∞ exp(iλt) dZ(λ) + ∫₀^∞ exp(−iλt) dZ(−λ)
        = ∫₀^∞ exp(iλt) dZ(λ) + ∫₀^∞ exp(−iλt) dconj(Z(λ))
Using Euler’s formula exp(iλt) = cos(λt) + i·sin(λt):
    X_t = ∫₀^∞ [cos(λt) + i·sin(λt)] dZ(λ) + ∫₀^∞ [cos(λt) − i·sin(λt)] dconj(Z(λ))
        = ∫₀^∞ cos(λt) [dZ(λ) + dconj(Z(λ))] + i ∫₀^∞ sin(λt) [dZ(λ) − dconj(Z(λ))]
Since X_t is real, imaginary part must vanish, and using the above definitions:
    X_t = ∫₀^∞ cos(λt) dU(λ) + ∫₀^∞ sin(λt) dV(λ)

Corollary (Orthogonality Properties)
------------------------------------
The real random measures U(B) and V(B) above satisfy:
  1. E[U(B₁)U(B₂)] = 0 for disjoint Borel sets B₁, B₂ ⊆ [0, ∞)
  2. E[V(B₁)V(B₂)] = 0 for disjoint Borel sets B₁, B₂ ⊆ [0, ∞)
  3. E[U(B₁)V(B₂)] = 0 for any Borel sets B₁, B₂ ⊆ [0, ∞)
  4. E[U(B)²] = E[V(B)²] = 2·F(B) where F(·) is the spectral measure

Proof Sketch:
-------------
From U(B) = Z(B) + conj(Z(B)), V(B) = i·(conj(Z(B)) − Z(B)), and the properties of Z(B):
- For disjoint B₁, B₂, all cross terms vanish due to orthogonality.
- E[U(B)²] = E[(Z(B) + conj(Z(B)))²] = 2·E[|Z(B)|²] = 2·F(B)
- Similarly for V(B).
