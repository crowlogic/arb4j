At least one of the coordinates in the path I'm about to
digitize was really huge (potentially bigger than 4095).
So I've cut it back to the maximum size.
The results will probably be pretty wild.

So I've cut it back to the maximum size.
The results will probably be pretty wild.

so I'll probably have trouble drawing it.

At least one of the coordinates in the path I'm about to
digitize was really huge (potentially bigger than 4095).
So I've cut it back to the maximum size.
The results will probably be pretty wild.
