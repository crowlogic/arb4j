/**
 * The domain of a {@link arb.functions.Function} is the set of inputs accepted
 * by the function. It is sometimes denoted by dom(f) where f is the function.
 * 
 * More precisely, given a function f : X â†’ Y the domain of f is X. In modern
 * mathematical language, the domain is part of the definition of a function
 * rather than a property of it.
