/**
 * a level structure on a space X is an extra structure attached to X that
 * shrinks or eliminates the automorphism group of X, by demanding automorphisms
 * to preserve the level structure; attaching a level structure is often phrased
 * as rigidifying the geometry of X.[1][2]
 * 
 * In applications, a level structure is used in the construction of moduli
 * spaces; a moduli space is often constructed as a quotient. The presence of
 * automorphisms poses a difficulty to forming a quotient; thus introducing
 * level structures helps overcome this difficulty.
 * 
 * There is no single definition of a level structure; rather, depending on the
 * space X, one introduces the notion of a level structure. The classic one is
 * that on an elliptic curve (see #Example: an abelian scheme). There is a level
 * structure attached to a formal group called a Drinfeld level structure,
 * introduced in
