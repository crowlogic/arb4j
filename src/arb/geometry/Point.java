/**
 * Point
 * 
 * A point is a 0-dimensional mathematical object which can be specified in
 * n-dimensional space using an n-tuple (x_1, x_2, ..., x_n) consisting of n
 * coordinates. In dimensions greater than or equal to two, points are sometimes
 * considered synonymous with vectors and so points in n-dimensional space are
 * sometimes called n-vectors.
 * 
 * Although the notion of a point is intuitively rather clear, the mathematical
 * machinery used to deal with points and point-like objects can be surprisingly
 * slippery. This difficulty was encountered by none other than Euclid himself
 * who, in his Elements, gave the vague definition of a point as "that which has
 * no part."
 * 
 * The basic geometric structures of higher dimensional geometry--the
 * {@link Line}, {@link Plane}, {@link TopologicalSpace}, and hyperspace--are all built up
 * of infinite numbers of points arranged in particular ways.
 * 
 * These facts lead to the mathematical pun, "without geometry, life is
 * pointless."
 * 
 * The decimal point in a decimal expansion is voiced as "point" in the United
 * States, e.g., 3.1415 is voiced "three point one four one five," whereas a
 * comma is used for this purpose in continental Europe.
