 * 
 * a {@link SymplecticManifold} is a {@link DifferentiableManifold}, nondegenerate
 * differential 2-form Ï‰ , called the symplectic form. The study of
 * symplectic manifolds is called symplectic geometry or symplectic topology.
 * Symplectic manifolds arise naturally in abstract formulations of classical
 * mechanics and analytical mechanics as the cotangent bundles of manifolds. For
 * example, in the Hamiltonian formulation of classical mechanics, which
 * provides one of the major motivations for the field, the set of all possible
 * configurations of a system is modeled as a manifold, and this manifold's
 * cotangent bundle describes the phase space of the system.
