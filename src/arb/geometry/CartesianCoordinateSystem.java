/**
 * A Cartesian coordinate system (UK: /kɑːˈtiːzjən/, US: /kɑːrˈtiʒən/) in a
 * plane is a coordinate system that specifies each point uniquely by a pair of
 * numerical coordinates, which are the signed distances to the point from two
 * fixed perpendicular oriented lines, measured in the same unit of length. Each
 * reference coordinate line is called a coordinate axis or just axis (plural
 * axes) of the system, and the point where they meet is its origin, at ordered
 * pair (0, 0). The coordinates can also be defined as the positions of the
 * perpendicular projections of the point onto the two axes, expressed as signed
 * distances from the origin.
 * 
 * One can use the same principle to specify the position of any point in
 * three-dimensional space by three Cartesian coordinates, its signed distances
 * to three mutually perpendicular planes (or, equivalently, by its
 * perpendicular projection onto three mutually perpendicular lines). In
 * general, n Cartesian coordinates (an element of real n-space) specify the
 * point in an n-dimensional Euclidean space for any dimension n. These
 * coordinates are equal, up to sign, to distances from the point to n mutually
 * perpendicular hyperplanes.
