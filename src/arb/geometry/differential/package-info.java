/**
 * Differential geometry is a mathematical discipline that studies the geometry
 * of smooth shapes and {@link arb.topological.Space}s, otherwise known as
 * smooth {@link arb.geometry.Manifold}s. It uses the techniques of differential
 * calculus, integral calculus, linear algebra and multilinear algebra. The
 * field has its origins in the study of spherical geometry as far back as
 * antiquity. It also relates to astronomy, the geodesy of the Earth, and later
 * the study of hyperbolic geometry by Lobachevsky. The simplest examples of
 * smooth {@link arb.topological.Space}s are the plane and space
 * {@link arb.geometry.curves.Curve} and {@link arb.geometry.surfaces.Surface}
 * in the three-dimensional {@link arb.topological.spaces.EuclideanSpace}, and
 * the study of these shapes formed the basis for development of modern
 * differential geometry during the 18th and 19th centuries.
