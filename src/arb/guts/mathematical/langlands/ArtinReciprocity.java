/**
 * The Artin reciprocity law, which was established by Emil Artin in a series of
 * papers (1924; 1927; 1930), is a general theorem in number theory that forms a
 * central part of {@link GlobalClassFieldTheory}. The term "reciprocity law"
 * refers to a long line of more concrete number theoretic statements which it
 * generalized, from the quadratic reciprocity law and the reciprocity laws of
 * Eisenstein and Kummer to Hilbert's product formula for the norm symbol.
 * Artin's result provided a partial solution to Hilbert's ninth problem.
