/**
 * Yang–Mills theory is a {@link GaugeTheory} based on a special unitary group
 * SU(N), or more generally any compact, reductive Lie algebra. Yang–Mills
 * theory seeks to describe the behavior of <b>elementary particles</b> using these
 * non-commutative Lie groups and is at the core of the unification of the
 * electromagnetic force and weak forces (i.e. U(1) × SU(2)) as well as quantum
 * chromodynamics, the theory of the strong force (based on SU(3)). Thus it
 * forms the basis of our understanding of the Standard Model of particle
 * physics.
