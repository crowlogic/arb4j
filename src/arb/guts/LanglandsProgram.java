/**

is a grand unified theory of mathematics which includes the search for {@link LanglandsReciprocity} 
which is a generalization of {@link ArtinReciprocity} to non-Abelian Galois extensions of 
number fields. 

In a January 1967 letter to Andr√© Weil, Langlands proposed that the mathematics 
of algebra (Galois representations) and analysis (automorphic forms) are intimately related, 
and that congruences over finite fields are related to infinite-dimensional representation theory. 

In particular, Langlands conjectured that the transformations behind general reciprocity laws 
could be represented by means of matrices such as {@link RealMatrix} and {@link ComplexMatrix}

In 1998, three mathematicians proved Langlands' conjectures for local fields, and in a November 1999 
lecture at the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton University, L. Lafforgue presented a proof 
of the conjectures for function fields. This leaves only the case of {@link NumberField}s unresolved.
