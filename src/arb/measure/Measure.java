/**
 * the concept of a measure is a generalization and formalization of geometrical
 * measures (length, area, volume) and other common notions, such as mass and
 * probability of events. These seemingly distinct concepts have many
 * similarities and can often be treated together in a single mathematical
 * context. Measures are foundational in probability theory, integration theory,
 * and can be generalized to assume negative values, as with electrical charge.
 * Far-reaching generalizations (such as spectral measures and projection-valued
 * measures) of measure are widely used in quantum physics and physics in
 * general.
