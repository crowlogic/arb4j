  has the X nature
  nature
  
     (From Zen Buddhist koans of the form "Does an X have the
     Buddha-nature?") Common hacker construction for "is an X",
     used for humorous emphasis.  "Anyone who can't even use a
     program with on-screen help embedded in it truly has the
     {loser} nature!"  See also {the X that can be Y is not the
     true X}.
