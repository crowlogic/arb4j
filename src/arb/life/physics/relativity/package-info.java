/**
 * In analogy to the distinction between quantum and classical mechanics, Albert
 * Einstein's general and special theories of relativity have expanded the scope
 * of Newton and Galileo's formulation of mechanics. The differences between
 * relativistic and Newtonian mechanics become significant and even dominant as
 * the velocity of a body approaches the speed of light. For instance, in
 * Newtonian mechanics, the kinetic energy of a free particle is E=(mv²)/2,
 * whereas in relativistic mechanics, it is E = (γ-1)mc² (where γ is the Lorentz
 * factor; this formula reduces to the Newtonian expression in the low energy
 * limit).
 * 
 * For high-energy processes, quantum mechanics must be adjusted to account for
 * special relativity; this has led to the development of quantum field theory.[
