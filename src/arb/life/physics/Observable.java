/**
 * In physics, an observable is a physical quantity that can be measured.
 * Examples include position and momentum. In systems governed by classical
 * mechanics, it is a real-valued "function" on the set of all possible system
 * states. In quantum physics, it is an operator, or gauge, where the property
 * of the quantum state can be determined by some sequence of operations. For
 * example, these operations might involve submitting the system to various
 * electromagnetic fields and eventually reading a value.
 * 
 * Physically meaningful observables must also satisfy transformation laws that
 * relate observations performed by different observers in different frames of
 * reference. These transformation laws are automorphisms of the state space,
 * that is bijective transformations that preserve certain mathematical
 * properties of the space in question.
