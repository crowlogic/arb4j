/**
 * A {@link RandomVariable} (also called random quantity, aleatory variable, or
 * stochastic variable) is a mathematical formalization of a quantity or object
 * which depends on random events. It is a mapping or a function from possible
 * outcomes in a sample space to a measurable space, often the real numbers.
 * This graph shows how random variable is a function from all possible outcomes
 * to real values. It also shows how random variable is used for defining
 * {@link RealProbabilityDensityFunction}.
 * 
 * Informally, randomness typically represents some fundamental element of
 * chance, such as in the roll of a dice; it may also represent uncertainty,
 * such as measurement error.[1] However, the interpretation of probability is
 * philosophically complicated, and even in specific cases is not always
 * straightforward. The purely mathematical analysis of random variables is
 * independent of such interpretational difficulties, and can be based upon a
 * rigorous axiomatic setup.
 * 
 * In the formal mathematical language of measure theory, a random variable is
 * defined as a measurable function from a probability measure space (called the
 * sample space) to a measurable space. This allows consideration of the
 * pushforward measure, which is called the distribution of the random variable;
 * the distribution is thus a probability measure on the set of all possible
 * values of the random variable. It is possible for two random variables to
 * have identical distributions but to differ in significant ways; for instance,
 * they may be independent.
 * 
 * It is common to consider the special cases of discrete random variables and
 * absolutely continuous random variables, corresponding to whether a random
 * variable is valued in a discrete set (such as a finite set) or in an interval
 * of real numbers. There are other important possibilities, especially in the
 * theory of stochastic processes, wherein it is natural to consider random
 * sequences or random functions. Sometimes a random variable is taken to be
 * automatically valued in the real numbers, with more general random quantities
 * instead being called random elements.
