/**
 * The mathematical formulations of quantum mechanics are those mathematical
 * formalisms that permit a rigorous description of quantum mechanics. This
 * mathematical formalism uses mainly a part of functional analysis, especially
 * {@link arb.topological.spaces.HilbertSpace}, which are a kind of
 * {@link arb.topological.spaces.LinearSpace}. Such are distinguished from
 * mathematical formalisms for physics theories developed prior to the early
 * 1900s by the use of abstract mathematical structures, such as
 * infinite-dimensional {@link arb.topological.spaces.HilbertSpace} (L2 space
 * mainly), and operators on these spaces. In brief, values of physical
 * observables such as energy and momentum were no longer considered as values
 * of functions on phase space, but as eigenvalues; more precisely as spectral
 * values of linear operators in {@link arb.topological.spaces.HilbertSpace}.
 * 
 * These formulations of quantum mechanics continue to be used today. At the
 * heart of the description are ideas of quantum state and quantum observables,
 * which are radically different from those used in previous models of physical
 * reality. While the mathematics permits calculation of many quantities that
 * can be measured experimentally, there is a definite theoretical limit to
 * values that can be simultaneously measured. This limitation was first
 * elucidated by Heisenberg through a thought experiment, and is represented
 * mathematically in the new formalism by the non-commutativity of operators
 * representing quantum observables.
 * 
 * Prior to the development of quantum mechanics as a separate theory, the
 * mathematics used in physics consisted mainly of formal mathematical analysis,
 * beginning with calculus, and increasing in complexity up to differential
 * geometry and partial differential equations.
 * {@link arb.theoretical.ProbabilityTheory} was used in statistical mechanics.
 * Geometric intuition played a strong role in the first two and, accordingly,
 * theories of relativity were formulated entirely in terms of differential
 * geometric concepts. The phenomenology of quantum physics arose roughly
 * between 1895 and 1915, and for the 10 to 15 years before the development of
 * quantum mechanics (around 1925) physicists continued to think of quantum
 * theory within the confines of what is now called classical physics, and in
 * particular within the same mathematical structures. The most sophisticated
 * example of this is the Sommerfeld–Wilson–Ishiwara quantization rule, which
 * was formulated entirely on the classical
 * {@link arb.dynamical.systems.PhaseSpace}.
