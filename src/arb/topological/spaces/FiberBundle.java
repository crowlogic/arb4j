/**
 * In mathematics, and particularly topology, a fiber bundle (or, in
 * Commonwealth English: fibre bundle) is a space that is locally a product
 * space, but globally may have a different topological structure. Specifically,
 * the similarity between a space E {\displaystyle E} E and a product space B ×
 * F {\displaystyle B\times F} {\displaystyle B\times F} is defined using a
 * continuous surjective map, π : E → B , {\displaystyle \pi :E\to B,}
 * {\displaystyle \pi :E\to B,} that in small regions of E {\displaystyle E} E
 * behaves just like a projection from corresponding regions of B × F
 * {\displaystyle B\times F} {\displaystyle B\times F} to B . {\displaystyle B.}
 * B. The map π , {\displaystyle \pi ,} \pi, called the projection or submersion
 * of the bundle, is regarded as part of the structure of the bundle. The space
 * E {\displaystyle E} E is known as the total space of the fiber bundle, B
 * {\displaystyle B} B as the base space, and F {\displaystyle F} F the fiber.
 * 
 * In the trivial case, E {\displaystyle E} E is just B × F , {\displaystyle
 * B\times F,} {\displaystyle B\times F,} and the map π {\displaystyle \pi } \pi
 * is just the projection from the product space to the first factor. This is
 * called a trivial bundle. Examples of non-trivial fiber bundles include the
 * Möbius strip and Klein bottle, as well as nontrivial covering spaces. Fiber
 * bundles, such as the tangent bundle of a manifold and other more general
 * vector bundles, play an important role in differential geometry and
 * differential topology, as do principal bundles.
 * 
 * Mappings between total spaces of fiber bundles that "commute" with the
 * projection maps are known as bundle maps, and the class of fiber bundles
 * forms a category with respect to such mappings. A bundle map from the base
 * space itself (with the identity mapping as projection) to E {\displaystyle E}
 * E is called a section of E . {\displaystyle E.} E. Fiber bundles can be
 * specialized in a number of ways, the most common of which is requiring that
 * the transition maps between the local trivial patches lie in a certain
 * topological group, known as the structure group, acting on the fiber F
 * {\displaystyle F} F.
