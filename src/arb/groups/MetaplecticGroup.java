/**
 * the metaplectic group Mp2n is a double cover of the symplectic group Sp2n. It
 * can be defined over either real or p-adic numbers. The construction covers
 * more generally the case of an arbitrary local or finite field, and even the
 * ring of adeles.
 * 
 * The metaplectic group has a particularly significant infinite-dimensional
 * linear representation, the Weil representation.[1] It was used by André Weil
 * to give a representation-theoretic interpretation of theta functions, and is
 * important in the theory of modular forms of half-integral weight and the
 * theta correspondence.
 * 
 * TODO: the θ-correspondence is also related to representations of the
 * {@link HeisenbergGroup}, see
 * <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/0905.1865">https://arxiv.org/abs/0905.1865</a>
 * for instance
