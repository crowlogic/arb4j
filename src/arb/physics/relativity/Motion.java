/**
 * In physics, motion is the phenomenon in which an object changes its position
 * with respect to space and time. Motion is mathematically described in terms
 * of displacement, distance, velocity, acceleration, speed an frame of
 * reference to an observer and measuring the change in position of the body
 * relative to that frame with change in time. The branch of physics describing
 * the motion of objects without reference to its cause is kinematics; the
 * branch studying forces and their effect on motion is dynamics.
 * 
 * If an object is not changing relative to a given frame of reference, the
 * object is said to be at rest, motionless, immobile, stationary, or to have a
 * constant or time-invariant position with reference to its surroundings. As
 * there is no absolute frame of reference, absolute motion cannot be
 * determined.[1] Thus, everything in the universe can be considered to be in
 * motion
