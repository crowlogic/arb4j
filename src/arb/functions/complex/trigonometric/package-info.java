/**
 * The trigonometric functions are real functions which relate an angle of a
 * right-angled triangle to ratios of two side lengths. They are widely used in
 * all sciences that are related to geometry, such as navigation, solid
 * mechanics, celestial mechanics, geodesy, and many others. They are among the
 * simplest periodic functions, and as such are also widely used for studying
 * periodic phenomena through Fourier analysis.
