 *         the theory of elliptic functions, the nome is a special function and
 *         is given by
 * 
 *         q = e − π K ′ K = e i π ω 2 ω 1 = e i π τ { q=\mathrm
 *         {e} ^{-{\frac {\pi K'}{K}}}=\mathrm {e} ^{\frac {{\rm {i}}\pi \omega
 *         _{2}}{\omega _{1}}}=\mathrm {e} ^{{\rm {i}}\pi \tau }\,}
 *         {\displaystyle q=\mathrm {e} ^{-{\frac {\pi K'}{K}}}=\mathrm {e}
 *         ^{\frac {{\rm {i}}\pi \omega _{2}}{\omega _{1}}}=\mathrm {e} ^{{\rm
 *         {i}}\pi \tau }\,}
 * 
 *         where K and iK′ are the quarter periods, and ω1 and ω2 are the
 *         fundamental pair of periods, and τ = iK ′/K = ω2/ω1 is the
 *         half-period ratio. The nome can be taken to be a function of any one
 *         of these quantities; conversely, any one of these quantities can be
 *         taken as functions of the nome. Each of them uniquely determines the
 *         others when 0 < q < 1 { 0<q<1} { 0<q<1}.
 *         That is, when 0 < q < 1 { 0<q<1} { 0<q<1},
 *         the mappings between these various symbols are both 1-to-1 and onto,
 *         and so can be inverted: the quarter periods, the half-periods and the
 *         half-period ratio can be explicitly written as functions of the nome.
 *         For general q ∈ C { q\in \mathbb {C} } {
 *         q\in \mathbb {C} } with 0 < | q | < 1 { 0<|q|<1}
 *         { 0<|q|<1}, τ {\displaystyle \tau } \tau is not a
 *         single-valued function of q { q} q.
