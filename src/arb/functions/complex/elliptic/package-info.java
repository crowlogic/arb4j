/**
 * {@link arb.functions.complex.elliptic.EllipticFunction}s are a special kind
 * of {@link arb.functions.complex.MeromorphicFunction}s, that satisfy two
 * periodicity conditions. They are named
 * {@link arb.functions.complex.elliptic.EllipticFunction}s because they come
 * from elliptic integrals. Originally those integrals appeared in the
 * calculation of an ellipses' arc length.
 * 
 * Important elliptic functions are
 * {@link arb.functions.complex.elliptic.JacobiEllipticθFunction}s and the
 * Weierstrass ℘-function.
 * 
 * Further development of this theory led to hyperelliptic functions and modular
 * forms.
