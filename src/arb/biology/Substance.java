/**
 * A chemical substance is a form of matter having constant chemical composition
 * and characteristic properties.[1][2] Some references add that chemical
 * substance cannot be separated into its constituent elements by physical
 * separation methods, i.e., without breaking chemical bonds.[3] Chemical
 * substances can be simple substances,[4] chemical compounds, or alloys.
 * Chemical elements may or may not be included in the definition, depending on
 * expert viewpoint.[citation needed]
 * 
 * Chemical substances are often called 'pure' to set them apart from mixtures.
 * A common example of a chemical substance is pure water; it has the same
 * properties and the same ratio of hydrogen to oxygen whether it is isolated
 * from a river or made in a laboratory. Other chemical substances commonly
 * encountered in pure form are diamond (carbon), gold, table salt (sodium
 * chloride) and refined sugar (sucrose). However, in practice, no substance is
 * entirely pure, and chemical purity is specified according to the intended use
 * of the chemical.
 * 
 * Chemical substances exist as solids, liquids, gases, or plasma, and may
 * change between these phases of matter with changes in temperature or pressure
 * and time. Chemical substances may be combined or converted to others by means
 * of {@link ChemicalReaction}s.
