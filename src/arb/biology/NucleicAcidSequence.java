/**
 * A nucleic acid sequence is a succession of bases signified by a series of a
 * set of five different letters that indicate the order of nucleotides forming
 * alleles within a DNA (using GACT) or RNA (GACU) molecule. <br>
 * By convention, sequences are usually presented from the 5' end to the 3' end.
 * For DNA, the sense strand is used. Because nucleic acids are normally linear
 * (unbranched) polymers, specifying the sequence is equivalent to defining the
 * covalent structure of the entire molecule. For this reason, the nucleic acid
 * sequence is also termed the primary structure.
 * 
 * The sequence has capacity to represent information. <br>
 * Biological deoxyribonucleic acid represents the information which directs the
 * functions of an organism. <br>
 * 
 * Nucleic acids also have a secondary structure and tertiary structure. Primary
 * structure is sometimes mistakenly referred to as primary sequence.
 * Conversely, there is no parallel concept of secondary or tertiary sequence.
