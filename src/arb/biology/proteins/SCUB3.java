/**
 * This gene encodes a member of the signal peptide, complement subcomponents
 * C1r/C1s, Uegf, bone morphogenetic protein-1 and epidermal growth factor-like
 * domain containing protein family. <br>
 * 
 * Overexpression of this gene in human embryonic kidney cells results in
 * secretion of a glycosylated form of the protein that forms oligomers and
 * tethers to the cell surface. <br>
 * 
 * This gene is upregulated in lung cancer tumor tissue compared to healthy
 * tissue and is associated with loss of the epithelial marker E-cadherin and
 * with increased expression of vimentin, a mesenchymal marker. <br>
 * 
 * In addition, the protein encoded by this gene is a transforming growth factor
 * beta receptor ligand, and when secreted by cancer cells, it can be cleaved in
 * vitro to release the N-terminal epidermal growth factor-like repeat domain
 * and the C-terminal complement subcomponents C1r/C1s domain.<br>
 * 
 * Both the full length protein and C-terminal fragment can bind to the
 * transforming growth factor beta type II receptor to promote the
 * epithelial-mesenchymal transition and tumor angiogenesis. <br>
 * 
 * Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants. [provided by
 * RefSeq, Dec 2014]
