/**
 * The Langlands program is a grand unified theory of mathematics which includes
 * the search for {@link LanglandsReciprocity} which is a generalization of
 * {@link ArtinReciprocity} to non-Abelian Galois extensions of
 * {@link Field}s<br>
 * 
 * Langlands proposed that the mathematics of algebra of Galois representations
 * and analysis of automorphic forms are intimately related, and that
 * congruences over finite fields are related to infinite-dimensional
 * representation theory.<br.
 * 
 * In particular, Langlands particularly conjectured that the transformations
 * behind general {@link Reciprocity} laws could be represented by means of
 * matrices (such as {@link RealMatrix} and {@link ComplexMatrix} )<br>
 * 
 * In 1998, three mathematicians proved Langlands' conjectures for local fields,
 * and in a November 1999 lecture at the Institute for Advanced Study at
 * Princeton University, L. Lafforgue presented a proof of the conjectures for
 * function fields. This leaves only the case of {@link Field}s
 * unresolved.<br>
