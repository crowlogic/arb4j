/**
 * Amino acids are organic compounds that contain both amino and carboxylic acid
 * functional groups. Although hundreds of amino acids exist in nature, by far
 * the most important are the alpha-amino acids, which comprise proteins. Only
 * 22 alpha amino acids appear in the genetic code.
 * 
 * Amino acids can be classified according to the locations of the core
 * structural functional groups, as alpha- (α-), beta- (β-), gamma- (γ-) or
 * delta- (δ-) amino acids; other categories relate to polarity, ionization, and
 * side chain group type (aliphatic, acyclic, aromatic, containing hydroxyl or
 * sulfur, etc.). In the form of proteins, amino acid residues form the
 * second-largest component (water being the largest) of human muscles and other
 * tissues. Beyond their role as residues in proteins, amino acids participate
 * in a number of processes such as neurotransmitter transport and biosynthesis.
 * It is thought that they play a key role in enabling life on Earth and its
 * emergence.
