/**
 * a Bost–Connes system is a quantum statistical {@link DynamicalSystem} related
 * to an algebraic number field, whose partition function is related to the
 * Dedekind zeta function of the number field. Bost & Connes (1995) introduced
 * Bost–Connes systems by constructing one for the rational numbers. Connes,
 * Marcolli & Ramachandran (2005) extended the construction to imaginary
 * quadratic fields.
 * 
 * Such systems have been studied for their connection with Hilbert's Twelfth
 * Problem. In the case of a Bost–Connes system over Q, the absolute Galois
 * group acts on the ground states of the system.
