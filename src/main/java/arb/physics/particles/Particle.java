 * A particle is a small, localized object to which can be ascribed several
 * physical or chemical properties, such as volume, mass, or charge. In the
 * context of physics, particles are the basic units of matter and the
 * fundamental constituents of the universe. Particles can be classified into
 * two main types: elementary particles, which are not composed of smaller parts
 * and are defined as the basic building blocks of matter (such as quarks and
 * leptons, including electrons), and composite particles, which are made up of
 * two or more elementary particles bound together (such as protons, neutrons,
 * and atoms). The behavior and interactions of particles are described by
 * fields and fundamental forces in the framework of quantum mechanics and
 * quantum field theory.
