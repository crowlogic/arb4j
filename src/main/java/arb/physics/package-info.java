/**
 * Physics is the natural science that studies matter, its motion and behavior
 * through space and time, and the related entities of energy and force. It aims
 * to understand how the universe behaves, from the smallest subatomic particles
 * to the vastness of the cosmos. Physics encompasses a wide range of phenomena
 * and laws of nature, seeking to discover and characterize the fundamental
 * principles through experimentation, mathematical analysis, and theoretical
 * modeling. It is foundational to the development of new technologies and helps
 * us to answer fundamental questions about the nature of reality, the origin of
 * the universe, and the fundamental constituents of matter. Physics is divided
 * into multiple subfields, including classical mechanics, quantum mechanics,
 * relativity, thermodynamics, electromagnetism, and particle physics, each
 * focusing on specific aspects of the world.
