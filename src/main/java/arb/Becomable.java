   * `Real` object `this` absorbs all the properties and state of another `Real`
   * object `that`, effectively transforming into it.
   * 
   * Just as the T-1000 assumes the physical appearance and characteristics of its
   * target, the `become` method copies the internal data pointers and state of
   * `that` into `this`. Moreover, by setting `that.swigCMemOwn` to false, it
   * ensures that `that` will no longer assume the responsibility of freeing the
   * memory when its {@link #close()} method is called, much like the target no
   * longer retaining their form once the T-1000 transforms into them.
   * 
   * This approach ensures that the original object (`this`) now fully embodies
   * the other object (`that`).
