/**
 * A CompactSubspace is a subspace of a topological space which is compact. In
 * terms of open covers, this means that every open cover of the set has a
 * finite subcover.
 *
 * This interface extends the TopologicalSpace interface and should be
 * implemented by classes representing specific types of compact subspaces.
 *
 * Compact subspaces have interesting properties, such as the fact that any
 * continuous image of a compact space is compact. This makes compactness a very
 * important concept in topology.
 *
 * Note: This interface should be implemented by classes that ensure their
 * instances indeed represent compact subspaces. It doesn't add any additional
 * methods but serves as a marker for the mathematical property of compactness.
