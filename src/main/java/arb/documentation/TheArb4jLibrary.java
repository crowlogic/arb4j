/**
 * <pre>
 * The library arb4j is a Java adaptation of the ARB library, a powerful tool
 * designed for rigorous high-performance mathematical computation with arbitrary 
 * (unlimited) precision. This library is particularly tailored to support high-precision 
 * calculations in all fields of science. arb4j leverages the capabilities of ARB to 
 * provide the ability to perform complex mathematical operations in Java, 
 * including but not limited to, high-precision arithmetic, transcendental functions, 
 * and special functions, orthogonal polynomials, spectral solvers for fractional Ricatti
 * differential equations with guaranteed bounds on the error of the computed
 * results and more.
 * 
 * At its core, arb4j offers an interface that merges the precision of the ARB
 * library with the versatility and platform-independence of Java, making it an
 * indispensable tool for computational tasks where accuracy and reliability are
 * paramount. The library encapsulates functionalities to handle {@link Real} and
 * {@link Complex} numbers with arbitrary precision, facilitating operations that go
 * above and beyond the scope of standard double-precision arithmetic. This includes
 * the computation of functions to an arbitrary number of significant digits,
 * with a clear and straightforward approach to managing the precision and error
 * bounds of calculations.
 * 
 * arb4j is designed with usability in mind, providing a straightforward API
 * that allows users to easily integrate high-precision computations into their
 * Java applications. The library serves as a bridge, extending the ARB
 * library's capabilities to Java, thus enabling development of applications not
 * limited by C.
 * 
 * In essence, arb4j has turned out to be valuable resource for scientific computing with
 * Java, offering precision, flexibility, and error
 * control that are crucial for technical computing tasks demanding the utmost
 * accuracy, performance, and very importantly, maintainability.
