/**
 * The point at infinity in topology is an excellent example of an exophoric
 * reference in mathematics.
 * 
 * <ol>
 * <li>Exophoric Nature:
 * <ul>
 * <li>In linguistics, an exophoric reference points to something outside the
 * text itself.</li>
 * <li>The point at infinity in topology similarly refers to a concept that
 * exists "outside" the original space X.</li>
 * </ul>
 * </li>
 * 
 * <li>Context-Dependent Meaning:
 * <ul>
 * <li>The meaning of the point at infinity depends on the context of the entire
 * topological space X.</li>
 * <li>It's not fully defined by any local properties but requires understanding
 * the global structure of X.</li>
 * </ul>
 * </li>
 * 
 * <li>Implicit Reference:
 * <ul>
 * <li>The point at infinity implicitly refers to the behavior of the entire
 * space "at the limit".</li>
 * <li>This is similar to how "it" in "it's raining" implicitly refers to the
 * weather or environment.</li>
 * </ul>
 * </li>
 * 
 * <li>Resolution Through Context:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Understanding what "infinity" means in a given topological space requires
 * resolving it through the context of the space's properties.</li>
 * <li>This is analogous to how exophoric references in language are resolved
 * through broader context.</li>
 * </ul>
 * </li>
 * 
 * <li>Bridging Intuition and Formalism:
 * <ul>
 * <li>The point at infinity bridges intuitive notions of "infinity" with formal
 * topological structures.</li>
 * <li>This is similar to how exophoric references in language bridge shared
 * knowledge with specific communications.</li>
 * </ul>
 * </li>
 * </ol>
