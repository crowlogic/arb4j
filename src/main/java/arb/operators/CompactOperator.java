/**
 * Compact operators are a class of operators that map bounded sets into
 * relatively compact sets. Relative compactness is a generalization of
 * compactness suitable for non-closed sets.
 * 
 * The similarity of compact operators to finite-dimensional linear
 * transformations can be used to extend finite-dimensional intuition into
 * infinite-dimensional spaces.
 *
 * In particular, if the domain of the operator is a Banach space (or more
 * generally, a bounded linear space), boundedness of the operator is a
 * necessary condition for relative compactness of the image of a bounded set,
 * thus making all compact operators bounded.
 * 
 * So, compactness is a stronger condition than boundedness. Therefore, every
 * compact operator is a bounded operator, but not every bounded operator is a
 * compact operator.
