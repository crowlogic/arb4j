/**
 * A theory can be described as a collection of propositions or principles that
 * are considered true based on a substantial body of evidence, related to a
 * particular subject or phenomena, which it aims to explain and predict. A
 * scientific theory integrates and synthesizes knowledge across different
 * observations, experiments, and hypotheses to provide a comprehensive
 * understanding of a natural or physical phenomenon. It is characterized by its
 * broad applicability, allowing it to explain a wide range of occurrences and
 * predict new phenomena or the results of new experiments. The strength of a
 * theory lies in its ability to consistently and accurately describe
 * observations, withstand rigorous testing, and integrate new information
 * without being disproven.
