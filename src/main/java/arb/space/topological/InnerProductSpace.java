/**
 * An InnerProductSpace is a special type of NormedVectorSpace which is also
 * equipped with an inner product. The inner product is an operation that takes
 * two vectors and returns a scalar value, and it provides a way to introduce
 * geometrical concepts such as lengths and angles in the vector space. It is a
 * key concept in the field of functional analysis.
 *
 * This interface is parameterized over a field F that extends Field (the field
 * of scalars), a type VE representing vector elements, and a type V which is a
 * VectorSpace over the field F and the vector elements VE.
 * 
 * @param <F>  The type of the field over which the vector space is defined.
 *             This should extend the {@link Field} interface.
 * @param <VE> The type of the elements in the vector space.
 * @param <V>  The type of the vector space itself.
 *
