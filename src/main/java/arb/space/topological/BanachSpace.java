/**
 * 
 * A Banach space is a type of topological vector space. It is defined as a
 * complete normed vector space. In simpler terms, it is a vector space where
 * every Cauchy sequence of vectors within the space converges to a limit that
 * is also in the space. This completeness property allows mathematical analysis
 * techniques involving limits and continuity to be used effectively.
 *
 * Banach spaces are fundamental in the field of functional analysis, and have
 * wide applications in other areas of mathematics such as geometry,
 * infinite-dimensional topology, and probability theory.
 *
 * @param <F>  The type representing the field elements over which the vector
 *             space is defined.
 * @param <VE> The type representing the vector elements within the vector
 *             space.
 * @param <V>  The type representing the vector space itself.
