/**
 * A BornologicalSpace is a mathematical space in which the concept of
 * "boundedness" is well-defined, independent of a metric or topological
 * structure. This interface extends the more general {@link Space} interface,
 * indicating that a bornological space is a set of points with an additional
 * structure of "bornology".
 *
 * The bornology structure can be formally defined as a set of "bounded sets"
 * for each point, that satisfies certain axioms. This bornology provides a
 * formalized understanding of concepts like boundedness, absorbency and
 * balancedness.
 *
 * A bornological space is a fundamental concept in analysis and topology.
 * Common types of bornological spaces include {@link NormedSpace},
 * {@link MetricSpace}s , and locally convex spaces.
 *
 * The study of bornological spaces in their own right is referred to as
 * "bornological analysis".
 *
 * Note: This interface should be implemented by classes representing specific
 * types of bornological spaces. It defines a default method {@link #bornology}
 * that should be overridden to provide the specific {@link Bornology} structure
 * of the space.
 *
 * @param <X> the type of elements in the space
