/**
 * <h2>The Discriminant</h2>
 * <p>
 * The discriminant is a function that determines the nature of roots in a
 * quadratic equation. For a quadratic equation ax² + bx + c = 0, the
 * discriminant is defined by the formula D = b² - 4ac.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <h3>Discriminant and Root Nature</h3>
 * <p>
 * The discriminant reveals crucial information about the roots of a quadratic
 * equation:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>If D > 0: There are two distinct {@link Real} roots</li>
 * <li>If D = 0: There is one repeated {@link Real} root</li>
 * <li>If D < 0: There are no real roots, it has only {@link Complex} roots</li>
 * </ul>
 * 
 * <h2>Relationship to Riccati Equation</h2>
 * <p>
 * The Riccati equation is a first-order ordinary differential equation that is
 * quadratic in the unknown function, expressed as:
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * y′(x) = p(x) + q(x)y(x) + r(x)y²(x)
 * </p>
 * 
 * <h3>Fractional Riccati Differential Equation</h3>
 * <p>
 * In the fractional Riccati equation, the discriminant plays a similar role in
 * determining solution characteristics. For a fractional Riccati differential
 * equation, researchers analyze three cases based on the discriminant:
 * </p>
 * <ol>
 * <li>When discriminant △ = B² - 4AC > 0: The equation can be reformulated into
 * a specific solution form</li>
 * <li>When discriminant △ = 0: A special case with unique solution
 * properties</li>
 * <li>When discriminant △ < 0: The equation becomes more complex, requiring
 * advanced integration techniques</li>
 * </ol>
 * 
 * <p>
 * The discriminant provides a direct method to classify the solution space of
 * both standard and fractional Riccati equations.
 * </p>
 * <h2>Discriminant as Convergence Measure</h2>
 * <p>
 * The discriminant △(x) = q²(x) - 4p(x)r(x) is a function of all parameters
 * embedded in p(x), q(x), and r(x). When Newton's method converges, it finds
 * values making △(x) = 0 (or arbitrarily close).
 * </p>
 * 
 * <h3>Convergence Properties</h3>
 * <ol>
 * <li>At convergence, we've found a solution where the quadratic, linear, and
 * constant terms balance</li>
 * <li>This balance point is exactly where △(x) = 0</li>
 * <li>The parameters in p,q,r determine where these balance points exist</li>
 * </ol>
 * 
 * <p>
 * The discriminant isn't a static property - it's a dynamic measure of how
 * close we are to a solution given the parameter values we're working with.
 * </p>
 * <h1>Functional-Based Renaming of the Riccati Equation</h1>
 * <p>
 * The Riccati equation could be more functionally renamed as the
 * <strong>"Quadratic First-Order Differential Transform"</strong> equation
 * since it is:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>A first-order differential equation that is quadratic in the unknown
 * function</li>
 * <li>Can be transformed into other functional forms:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Second-order linear ODE through substitution</li>
 * <li>Bernoulli equation when specific coefficients are zero</li>
 * <li>Linear differential equation under certain conditions</li>
 * </ul>
 * </li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * The name would capture its key functional characteristics:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * <li><strong>"Quadratic"</strong> indicates its defining nonlinear nature</li>
 * <li><strong>"First-Order"</strong> specifies its differential order</li>
 * <li><strong>"Transform"</strong> reflects its ability to be converted into
 * other equation types</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * This functional naming better conveys its mathematical structure and behavior
 * compared to the eponymous name that requires historical knowledge of Jacopo
 * Riccati.
