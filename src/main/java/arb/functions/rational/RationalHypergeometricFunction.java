/**
 * Represents a finite hypergeometric series as <br>
 * <br>
 * pFq:Σn➔zⁿ*∏k➔α[k]₍ₙ₎{k=1…p}/(n!*∏k➔β[k]₍ₙ₎{k=1…q}){n=0…N} <br>
 * <br>
 * 
 * This class encapsulates the computation and representation of hypergeometric
 * polynomials, which are derived from the general hypergeometric series when
 * the existence of a negative integer in the numerator leads to its completion
 * after a finite number of terms in the sense that all of the terms after a
 * certain index are equal to 0.
 * <p>
 * A hypergeometric series is finite and simplifies into a polynomial when at
 * least one of its upper parameters (α) is a negative integer. This condition
 * ensures that the series has a finite number of non-zero terms, making it
 * possible to represent the series as a polynomial of finite degree.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The implementation uses parameters p and q, which are the dimensions of
 * vectors α and β, respectively. These parameters, along with the vectors
 * themselves, define the hypergeometric series.<br>
 * <br>
 * 
 * The notation x₍n₎ represents the n-th
 * {@link Real#ascendingFactorial(long, int, Real)} of x. <br>
 * <br>
 * 
 * The series is evaluated up to a specific order N, determined by the smallest
 * non-positive integer in α, ensuring the series is finite. This class provides
 * methods to initialize the polynomial, verify the finiteness condition, and
 * evaluate the polynomial, encapsulating the complexity of handling
 * hypergeometric functions in a computational context.
