/**
 * In the interest of keeping the architecture lean and focused on the intrinsic
 * expressability of the ideas themselves as they relate to each other, avoiding
 * overly complex or unnecessary components, it is considered a more integrated
 * and streamlined approach to incorporate inference capabilities directly into
 * the logic of the classes constituting the API. This approach emphasizes the
 * natural interplay between logical constructs and their use in inference
 * within the codebase, focusing on the effectiveness and clarity of the
 * programming constructs themselves.
 * 
 * ### Direct Integration of Inference in Logic Constructs
 * 
 * The idea here is to imbue the logical constructs themselves—the
 * representation of expressions, functions, predicates, etc.—with the
 * capability to participate in inference directly. This can lead to a design
 * where the logic and inference are not separate but are aspects of the same
 * fundamental operations. Here are some strategies to achieve this:
 * 
 * #### Embedding Inference Rules in Logical Constructs
 * 
 * 1. **Logical Expressions and Operations**: Each logical operation (such as
 * conjunction, disjunction, implication) can be designed to inherently consider
 * the implications of its operation. For example, an implication operation
 * could directly support modus ponens as part of its evaluation process.
 * 
 * 2. **Dynamic Interpretation of Symbols**: By allowing predicate and function
 * symbols to carry with them a framework for interpretation, you can
 * dynamically adjust how these symbols are interpreted in different contexts,
 * directly supporting the inference process.
 * 
 * 3. **Contextual Evaluation**: Incorporate a contextual evaluation system
 * where the truth or outcome of logical expressions can be determined by the
 * current known truths (or state of knowledge) within the system, allowing for
 * a form of dynamic inference based on the accumulation of knowledge.
