/**
 * A {@link MeasureSpace} is a basic {@link Space} of {@link MeasureTheory} which
 * generalizes the notion of volume. It contains an underlying set, the subsets
 * of this set that are feasible for measuring (the {@link σField}) and the
 * method that is used for measuring (the {@link Measure}). One important
 * example of a measure space is a {@link ProbabilitySpace}.
 * 
 * A measurable space consists of the first two components without a specific
 * measure, thus.
 * 
 * A measure space is a triple <b>(Σ,A,μ)</b> where<br>
 * 
 * <pre>
 * X is a set
 * Σ is the σField of the set X
 * μ is a {@link Measure} on (X,Σ)
 * </pre>
 * 
 * In other words, a measure space consists of a {@link MeasurableSpace} (Σ,A )
 * together with a {@link Measure} on it and thus {@link MeasureSpace} extends
 * {@link MeasurableSpace} and provides the method this{@link #μ()} to specify
 * the measure
