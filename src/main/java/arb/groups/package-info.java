/**
 * Group theory studies the algebraic structures known as {@link Group}.
 * The concept of a group is central to abstract algebra: other well-known
 * algebraic structures, such as rings, {@link arb.Field}s, and {@link arb.space.topological.VectorSpace}s,
 * can all be seen as groups endowed with additional operations and axioms.
 * Groups recur throughout mathematics, and the methods of group theory have
 * influenced many parts of algebra. Linear algebraic groups and
 * {@link LieGroup} are two branches of group theory that have advanced and
 * become subject areas in their own right.
